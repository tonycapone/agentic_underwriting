# Hypertension

## Definition & Classification

**Hypertension**: A chronic medical condition characterized by persistently elevated blood pressure in the arteries. Hypertension significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and other health problems.

### Classification Systems

**American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (2017)**:

| Category | Systolic BP (mmHg) | Diastolic BP (mmHg) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Normal | <120 | and <80 |
| Elevated | 120-129 | and <80 |
| Stage 1 Hypertension | 130-139 | or 80-89 |
| Stage 2 Hypertension | ≥140 | or ≥90 |
| Hypertensive Crisis | >180 | and/or >120 |

**Joint National Committee (JNC 8)**:

| Age Group | Target BP (mmHg) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| <60 years | <140/90 |
| ≥60 years | <150/90 |
| With diabetes or CKD | <140/90 |

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Blood pressure readings**:
   - Multiple readings over time (minimum 2-3 readings)
   - Both systolic and diastolic values
   - Circumstances of measurement (office, home, ambulatory)

2. **Medical history** including:
   - Duration of hypertension
   - Treatment history
   - Compliance with medication
   - Lifestyle modifications

3. **Diagnostic test results**:
   - Basic metabolic panel (kidney function)
   - Lipid profile
   - Urinalysis
   - ECG (if available)

4. **Risk factor assessment**:
   - Smoking status
   - Diabetes
   - Obesity
   - Family history
   - Physical activity level

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Echocardiogram (for left ventricular hypertrophy)
- Renal function tests (if kidney involvement suspected)
- Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
- Fundoscopic examination results (for retinopathy)
- Specialized tests for secondary hypertension causes

## Rating Guidelines

### Uncomplicated Hypertension

| Average BP (mmHg) | Age <40 | Age 40-60 | Age >60 |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| ≤140/90 (controlled) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 141-150/91-95 | +25 to +50 | 0 to +25 | 0 |
| 151-160/96-100 | +50 to +75 | +25 to +50 | 0 to +25 |
| 161-170/101-105 | +75 to +100 | +50 to +75 | +25 to +50 |
| 171-180/106-110 | +100 to +150 | +75 to +100 | +50 to +75 |
| >180/110 | Postpone until controlled | Postpone until controlled | Postpone until controlled |

**Modifying Factors**:
- Newly diagnosed (<6 months): +25 points until stability demonstrated
- Excellent control for >2 years: -25 points
- Compliance issues: +25 to +50 points
- Multiple medication changes within 12 months: +25 points
- Lifestyle modifications (weight loss, exercise, sodium restriction): -25 points

### Hypertension with Target Organ Damage

| Complication | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Left ventricular hypertrophy | +50 to +100 points |
| Hypertensive retinopathy (mild) | +25 to +50 points |
| Hypertensive retinopathy (moderate to severe) | +75 to +150 points |
| Microalbuminuria | +25 to +50 points |
| Proteinuria | +50 to +150 points depending on severity |
| Elevated creatinine | +50 to +200 points depending on severity |
| History of hypertensive crisis | +50 to +100 points |

### Hypertension with Comorbidities

| Comorbidity | Combined Rating Approach |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Diabetes | Rate for both conditions individually, then combine |
| Coronary artery disease | Rate for both conditions individually, then combine |
| Cerebrovascular disease | Rate for both conditions individually, then combine |
| Chronic kidney disease | Rate for both conditions individually, then combine |
| Peripheral arterial disease | Rate for both conditions individually, then combine |
| Obstructive sleep apnea | +1 to 2 tables if untreated |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Recently diagnosed hypertension (<1 month) without established control
2. Blood pressure consistently >180/110 mmHg
3. Recent change in medication regimen (<3 months)
4. Recent hypertensive emergency/crisis (<6 months)
5. Pending workup for secondary hypertension

### Decline

1. Malignant hypertension with papilledema
2. Hypertensive encephalopathy
3. Uncontrolled hypertension (>180/110) with:
   - Advanced target organ damage
   - Multiple failed medication regimens
   - Demonstrated non-compliance
4. Hypertension with end-stage renal disease
5. Hypertension with severe heart failure (NYHA Class III-IV)

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Class | Underwriting Significance |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Diuretics | First-line therapy, generally favorable |
| ACE inhibitors | First-line therapy, monitor for renal function |
| ARBs | Alternative to ACE inhibitors, similar profile |
| Calcium channel blockers | First-line therapy, generally favorable |
| Beta blockers | May indicate more severe or resistant hypertension |
| Alpha blockers | May indicate more complex hypertension |
| Central-acting agents | May indicate resistant hypertension |
| Direct vasodilators | May indicate severe or resistant hypertension |
| Aldosterone antagonists | May indicate resistant hypertension or heart failure |
| Combination therapy | Multiple agents may indicate more difficult control |

## Comorbidity Factors

The following conditions may increase hypertension ratings:

| Comorbidity | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Obesity (BMI >30) | +25 to +50 points |
| Diabetes | +25 to +100 points depending on control |
| Dyslipidemia | +25 points if uncontrolled |
| Smoking | +25 to +50 points |
| Family history of early CVD | +25 points |
| Metabolic syndrome | +25 to +50 points |
| Alcohol excess | +25 to +50 points |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Blood pressure control**:
   - Consistent readings <140/90 mmHg
   - Home monitoring documentation
   - Stable medication regimen

2. **Lifestyle modifications**:
   - Documented weight loss if previously overweight/obese
   - Regular exercise program
   - DASH diet adherence
   - Sodium restriction
   - Alcohol moderation

3. **Risk factor reduction**:
   - Smoking cessation
   - Lipid control
   - Diabetes management

4. **Time stability**:
   - Longer duration of control
   - No hospitalizations for hypertensive events
   - Stable medication regimen >2 years

## Secondary Hypertension

When hypertension is caused by an underlying condition:

| Cause | Underwriting Approach |
|-------|------------------------|
| Renal artery stenosis | Rate for hypertension + underlying condition |
| Pheochromocytoma | Rate after successful treatment, otherwise postpone/decline |
| Primary aldosteronism | Rate after successful treatment, otherwise +50 to +100 points |
| Cushing's syndrome | Rate after successful treatment, otherwise postpone/decline |
| Coarctation of aorta | Rate after successful repair, otherwise +50 to +150 points |
| Obstructive sleep apnea | Rate for hypertension + OSA, credit for CPAP compliance |
| Thyroid disease | Rate after normalization of thyroid function |

## Preferred Risk Considerations

For consideration of preferred rates, all of the following must be met:

1. Blood pressure consistently <130/80 mmHg
2. No medication required, or well-controlled on a single medication
3. No evidence of target organ damage
4. No other cardiovascular risk factors
5. Normal BMI
6. Regular exercise
7. No family history of early cardiovascular disease
