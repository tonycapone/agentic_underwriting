# Family History Scoring

This section provides guidelines for evaluating family medical history in life insurance underwriting. Family history is a significant predictor of mortality risk for various conditions, particularly when early-onset disease is present in first-degree relatives.

## General Principles

1. **Relevance**: Family history is most relevant for conditions with known hereditary or genetic components
2. **Predictive Value**: Early-onset disease in multiple relatives provides stronger predictive value than isolated cases
3. **Context**: Family history should be interpreted in conjunction with the applicant's own medical history and risk factors
4. **Degree of Relation**: First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) carry greater significance than more distant relations
5. **Age of Onset**: Premature or early-onset disease carries greater significance than disease occurring at advanced ages
6. **Treatment Advances**: Modern treatments may mitigate some hereditary risks compared to historical mortality data

## Special Family History Scenarios

### Adoption

When an applicant has been adopted and has limited or no knowledge of biological family history:

1. **No adverse information**: No rating for missing family history
2. **Partial information**: Evaluate available information only
3. **Non-medical adoption reason**: No rating for missing family history
4. **Known genetic condition in biological family**: Evaluate based on condition without testing
5. **Genetic testing completed**: Use results rather than family history

### Assisted Reproduction

When donor gametes were used:

1. **Egg/sperm donation**: Evaluate based on available donor health information
2. **Gestational carrier**: No consideration of carrier's health history
3. **Known genetic screening of donors**: Favorable consideration
4. **Unknown donor medical history**: No adverse action for missing information

### Half-Siblings

1. **Same medical condition in multiple half-siblings**: Less significant than full siblings
2. **Maternal half-siblings**: More significant for mitochondrial conditions
3. **Paternal half-siblings**: More significant for Y-chromosome linked conditions
4. **Multiple half-siblings from different parents affected**: More significant than single half-sibling

### Small Families

For applicants with few relatives:

1. **Only child**: Cannot penalize for absence of sibling history
2. **Limited family size**: Evaluate available information only
3. **Early parental death from accident/non-medical cause**: No adverse impact for missing history
4. **Known conditions in limited family members**: May carry more weight

## Genetic Testing Considerations

### Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Testing

1. **Consumer genetic testing without medical focus**: Generally not usable for underwriting
2. **Health-related genetic findings**: May be considered if verified by clinical testing
3. **Raw data interpretation by third parties**: Not acceptable without clinical confirmation
4. **Polygenic risk scores**: Currently insufficient predictive value for underwriting

### Clinical Genetic Testing

1. **Negative result for family mutation**: Significantly reduces family history impact
2. **Positive result for pathogenic variant**: Rate for condition based on penetrance
3. **Variant of uncertain significance (VUS)**: Cannot be used for adverse underwriting
4. **Presymptomatic testing positive**: Rate based on penetrance and severity
5. **Panel testing with incidental findings**: Evaluate based on clinical significance

## Age-Related Considerations

### Juvenile Applicants

Family history carries higher significance for juvenile applicants for conditions with early onset:

1. **Congenital/childhood conditions**: Higher scrutiny of family patterns
2. **Adult-onset conditions**: Less impact on juvenile underwriting
3. **Parent with early cardiac death**: More significant than for adult applicants
4. **Parent with condition typically diagnosable in childhood**: Higher significance if child currently unaffected

### Elderly Applicants

Family history impact diminishes with applicant age:

1. **Applicant age >70**: Significantly reduced family history impact
2. **Applicant age exceeding average onset in family**: Reduced debits
3. **Applicant outliving affected relatives**: Favorable consideration
4. **Late-onset conditions in family**: Standard consideration

## Data Collection and Verification

### Required Information

To properly evaluate family history, collect:

1. **Specific diagnosis**: Exact condition rather than general category
2. **Age at diagnosis**: Not just current age or age at death
3. **Treatment and outcome**: Course of disease and response to treatment
4. **Current status**: For living relatives with conditions
5. **Genetic test results**: For any family members tested
6. **Pattern of inheritance**: Maternal vs. paternal lineage

### Verification Methods

For significant family history findings:

1. **Attending Physician Statement (APS)**: May contain family history details
2. **Medical questionnaire**: Targeted questions about specific conditions
3. **Medical records of affected relatives**: With proper authorization
4. **Death certificates**: For verification of cause of death
5. **Genetic test reports**: For confirmation of hereditary syndromes

## Family History Updates

### Favorable Updates

Applicants previously rated for family history may request reconsideration with:

1. **New genetic testing results**: Negative results for family mutation
2. **Corrected diagnosis in family member**: Clarification of non-hereditary cause
3. **Reaching age milestone**: Exceeding typical age of onset
4. **New screening/prevention measures**: Compliant with enhanced surveillance

### Adverse Updates

Post-issue family history changes:

1. **New diagnosis in family after policy issue**: Cannot be used to modify in-force policy
2. **New genetic test results post-issue**: Cannot be used to modify in-force policy
3. **Contestability period considerations**: Material misrepresentation of known family history

## Documentation Standards

Underwriters should document:

1. **Sources of family history information**: Application, APS, questionnaire, etc.
2. **Verification attempts**: Efforts to confirm significant findings
3. **Risk assessment rationale**: Clear explanation of debits/credits applied
4. **Mitigating factors considered**: Reasons for reducing standard debits
5. **Specialist consultations**: Input from medical directors on complex cases

## Conclusion

Family history remains a valuable underwriting tool, especially for conditions with strong genetic components. Modern genetic testing, improved treatments, and preventive measures may modify the impact of family history in individual cases. A balanced approach considering both family patterns and the applicant's own health status and preventive measures provides the most accurate risk assessment.
