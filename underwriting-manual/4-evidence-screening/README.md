# Evidence & Screening Reference

This section provides reference tables and guidelines for interpreting various types of underwriting evidence, including laboratory values, physical measurements, diagnostic tests, prescription medications, and family history information.

## Purpose

The Evidence & Screening Reference section serves as a standardized guide for interpreting medical and non-medical evidence obtained during the underwriting process. It provides:

1. **Objective Criteria**: Standardized thresholds for laboratory and clinical measurements
2. **Interpretation Guidelines**: How to assess various test results and findings
3. **Risk Stratification**: Methods to classify applicants based on evidence
4. **Preferred Criteria**: Specific requirements for preferred risk classifications
5. **Referral Triggers**: When findings require additional review or investigation

## General Principles for Evidence Interpretation

1. **Clinical Context**: Consider all evidence within the context of the applicant's overall health profile
2. **Trending**: Multiple results over time are more valuable than isolated findings
3. **Age/Gender Norms**: Apply appropriate reference ranges based on demographic factors
4. **Confirmation**: Abnormal findings may require confirmation through additional testing
5. **Combinations**: Consider the combined impact of multiple borderline findings

## Evidence Collection Guidelines

### Timing of Evidence

| Evidence Type | Acceptable Timeframe | Preferred Timeframe |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Insurance labs | Within 12 months | Within 6 months |
| APS records | Within 24 months | Within 12 months |
| EKG/cardiac tests | Within 24 months | Within 12 months |
| Imaging studies | Within 36 months | Within 24 months |
| Functional assessments | Within 12 months | Within 6 months |

### Quality Control

1. **Identity Verification**: Confirm that evidence belongs to the applicant
2. **Completeness**: Ensure all required components are included
3. **Consistency**: Check for consistency across different evidence sources
4. **Chain of Custody**: Maintain proper handling of specimens and documents
5. **Certification**: Use only certified laboratories and examiners

## Special Considerations

1. **Borderline Values**: How to handle results at the threshold between categories
2. **Discrepant Findings**: Protocol for resolving contradictory evidence
3. **Non-Standard Tests**: Guidelines for interpreting specialized or novel tests
4. **International Reference Ranges**: Adjustments for tests performed outside the US
5. **Home Testing**: Policies regarding self-administered tests
