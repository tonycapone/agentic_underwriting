# Diagnostic Tests

This section provides guidelines for interpreting common diagnostic tests used in life insurance underwriting. Proper interpretation of these tests is essential for accurate risk assessment and appropriate classification of applicants.

## Cardiovascular Diagnostic Tests

### Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)

The electrocardiogram is a fundamental test that records the electrical activity of the heart.

1. **Clinical Context**: Always interpret diagnostic test results within the context of the applicant's complete medical history
2. **Multiple Tests**: When multiple tests are available, give more weight to the most recent and most comprehensive studies
3. **Trending**: Serial tests showing improvement or stability are more favorable than isolated abnormal findings
4. **Technical Quality**: Consider the technical quality and limitations of each test
5. **Borderline Results**: For borderline abnormalities, consider other risk factors and overall health status
6. **Incidental Findings**: Minor incidental findings often have minimal underwriting significance
7. **Follow-up Studies**: Ensure appropriate follow-up has been completed for abnormal findings
8. **Specialist Interpretation**: Defer to specialist interpretation for complex or equivocal findings
