## Disclosure Questions

Recommended application questions:

1. **Comprehensive inquiry**: "In the past 12 months, have you used nicotine or tobacco in any form (cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vaping, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, snuff, nicotine gum/patches, etc.)?"

2. **Former use**: "Have you ever regularly used tobacco or nicotine products of any kind?"
   - If yes: "Date last used?" and "Type of product?"

3. **Product-specific**: "Do you currently use any of the following:" (with all nicotine product types listed)

4. **Cessation methods**: "Are you currently using any smoking/nicotine cessation products or medications?"

## Underwriting Approach

### Risk Assessment Methodology

1. **Verify product type**:
   - Different products have distinct risk profiles
   - Consider combination usage

2. **Assess usage pattern**:
   - Frequency affects risk classification 
   - Duration of use impacts overall rating

3. **Evaluate cessation history**:
   - Pattern of quit attempts
   - Success of transitions to lower-risk products

4. **Consider overall health profile**:
   - Presence of related health conditions
   - Other risk factors that may compound nicotine risks

5. **Verify testing results**:
   - Cotinine levels consistent with reported usage
   - Appropriate follow-up for discrepancies

### Comparative Risk Hierarchy

From highest to lowest risk:

1. Cigarettes 
2. Small/machine-made cigars, hookah
3. Heat-not-burn products
4. Chewing tobacco/snuff
5. Regular e-cigarette/vaping (with nicotine)
6. Premium occasional cigars
7. Nicotine pouches/lozenges
