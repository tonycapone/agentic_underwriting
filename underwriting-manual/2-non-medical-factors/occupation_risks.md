# Occupation Risks

This section outlines underwriting guidelines for occupations that present elevated mortality risks due to workplace hazards, environmental exposures, or other job-related factors.

## General Principles

Occupational risk assessment considers:

1. **Hazard Exposure**: Type and degree of workplace dangers
2. **Frequency**: Regular vs. occasional exposure
3. **Duration**: Length of time in hazardous conditions
4. **Safety Measures**: Training, equipment, and protocols
5. **Industry Standards**: Compliance with regulations
6. **Company Safety Record**: Accident and fatality history

## Occupation Rating Classification

| Class 1 | Minimal occupational hazard | Office workers, teachers, retail | Standard |
| Class 2 | Slight occupational hazard | Skilled trades (indoor), healthcare | Standard to Table 2 |
