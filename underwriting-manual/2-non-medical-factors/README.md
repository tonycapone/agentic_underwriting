## Purpose

Non-medical factors play a crucial role in life insurance risk assessment, often revealing:

- Financial justification for coverage
- Exposure to hazardous activities
- Lifestyle choices affecting mortality
- Legal and behavioral risk indicators
- Geographic and environmental risk exposures

## General Principles for Non-Medical Underwriting

1. **Materiality**: Focus on factors with demonstrated mortality impact
2. **Proportionality**: Rating should be proportional to the increased risk
3. **Temporality**: Consider duration and frequency of exposure
4. **Mitigation**: Account for safety measures and risk reduction
5. **Disclosure**: Rely on accurate and complete information

## Documentation Requirements

Non-medical factors typically require specialized questionnaires and supporting documentation:

| Factor Type | Required Documentation |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Financial | Tax returns, financial statements, business valuations, loan documents |
| Occupational | Job description, safety protocols, specialized questionnaires |
| Avocational | Activity-specific questionnaires, certifications, licenses, logs |
| Lifestyle/Legal | MVR, criminal history check, drug/alcohol questionnaires |
| Foreign | Travel itineraries, visa status, residency documentation |

## Rating Approach

Non-medical factors are typically rated using:

1. **Table Ratings**: For chronic or persistent exposures
2. **Flat Extra Premiums**: For temporary or quantifiable exposures
3. **Exclusion Riders**: For specific activities (where permitted by law)
4. **Modified Face Amounts**: For financial underwriting adjustments
5. **Decline/Postpone**: For unacceptable or temporary high risks

## Special Considerations

1. **Combinations**: Multiple non-medical factors may have compounding effects
2. **Age Variations**: Some factors have different implications at different ages
3. **Temporal Changes**: Risk profiles may change over time with changing circumstances
4. **Regional Variations**: Some factors vary by geographic location
5. **Regulatory Constraints**: State regulations may limit certain underwriting factors
