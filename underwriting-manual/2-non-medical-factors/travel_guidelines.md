# Foreign Travel Guidelines

This document provides detailed guidelines for underwriting life insurance applications that involve foreign travel.

## Overview

Foreign travel risk assessment considers exposure to various mortality factors including:

- Health hazards and endemic diseases
- Political instability and civil unrest
- Terrorism risk
- Crime rates
- Infrastructure quality
- Healthcare access
- Environmental dangers
- Extreme sports/activities while traveling

## Risk Tier Classification System

Countries are classified into risk tiers based on comprehensive risk assessment from multiple sources including the U.S. State Department, CDC, WHO, and private security services.

### Tier 1: Low Risk

**Description**: Developed countries with stable governments, strong infrastructure, quality healthcare, and minimal security concerns.

**Examples**: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan

**Underwriting Approach**: Standard rates for most travel durations and purposes.

### Tier 2: Moderate Risk

**Description**: Countries with generally stable conditions but with some localized risks, moderate healthcare infrastructure, and/or specific regional concerns.

**Examples**: Mexico (tourist areas), Brazil (major cities), Argentina, Chile, Panama, Costa Rica, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia (major cities), Thailand, Malaysia, China (major cities), Vietnam, South Africa (urban), Morocco, Turkey, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Romania

**Underwriting Approach**: Standard to Table 2 depending on duration, frequency, purpose, and specific regions within countries.
