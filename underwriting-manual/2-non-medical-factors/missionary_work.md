# Missionary Work

This document provides detailed guidelines for underwriting life insurance applications involving missionary, humanitarian, and volunteer work abroad.

## Overview

Missionary and humanitarian work often involves travel to regions with elevated mortality risks due to:
- Limited healthcare infrastructure
- Exposure to endemic diseases
- Political instability
- Natural disaster vulnerability
- Personal security concerns
- Remote locations
- Limited evacuation capabilities

However, established organizations typically implement risk mitigation measures that can significantly reduce these exposures.

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Organization Type

| Organization Type | Risk Profile | Examples | Underwriting Considerations |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|
| **Large international relief agency** | Lower risk | Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF | Professional security teams, established protocols, evacuation plans |
| **Established religious mission** | Moderate risk | Mormon missions, Catholic Relief Services | Structured programs, established presence, variable security measures |
| **Small NGO/non-profit** | Variable risk | Local charities, grassroots organizations | Requires detailed assessment of security measures |
| **Independent/self-organized** | Highest risk | Independent missionaries, volunteer groups | Often lacks formal security protocols |

### Assignment Duration

| Duration | Risk Level | Underwriting Approach |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Short-term (<30 days)** | Lower risk | Rating based primarily on destination |
| **Medium-term (1-6 months)** | Moderate risk | Rating based on destination and organization |
| **Long-term (>6 months)** | Higher risk | Comprehensive evaluation required |
| **Permanent missionary** | Highest risk | Rate as foreign residency |

### Assignment Location

| Region Characteristics | Risk Level | Examples | Underwriting Considerations |
|------------------------|------------|----------|----------------------------|
| **Urban centers with good infrastructure** | Lower risk | Major cities in developing countries | Access to quality healthcare, easier evacuation |
| **Rural areas with basic infrastructure** | Moderate risk | Village outreach in stable regions | Delayed medical access, but accessible |
| **Remote areas with limited infrastructure** | Higher risk | Remote mountain villages, deep forest regions | Limited evacuation options, poor healthcare access |
| **Conflict/post-conflict zones** | Highest risk | War zones, areas with active insurgencies | Security threats, limited ability to evacuate |

|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Active conflict zones** | Generally decline | N/A |
| **Humanitarian corridors in conflict zones** | Individual consideration, minimum Table 8 | Detailed security protocols, evacuation plans, limited duration |
| **Regions with active terrorist threats** | Table 6+ to decline | Organization security measures, restricted movement protocols |
| **Ebola or similar outbreak zones** | Table 8+ to decline | Medical protocols, PPE training, infection control measures |
| **Areas with kidnapping history** | Table 6+ or flat extra | Kidnap prevention measures, ransom insurance |

### Recent Return Considerations
