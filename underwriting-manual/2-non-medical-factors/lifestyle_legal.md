# Lifestyle & Legal Factors

This document outlines the underwriting approach for lifestyle choices and legal histories that may impact mortality risk.

## Overview

Lifestyle choices and legal history provide significant insight into an individual's mortality risk profile. These factors often correlate with risk-taking behavior, substance abuse patterns, and adherence to societal norms, all of which can impact mortality.

## DUI/MVR Assessment

Driving history is a strong predictor of overall mortality risk, with multiple violations indicating potential risk-taking behavior.

### Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) Guidelines

| Violation Type | Frequency | Rating Decision |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Minor violations** (speeding <15mph over limit, failure to stop) | 1-2 in past 3 years | No rating |
| **Minor violations** | 3-5 in past 3 years | Table 2-3 |
| **Minor violations** | >5 in past 3 years | Table 4-6 |
| **Major violations** (reckless driving, racing, >30mph over limit) | 1 in past 3 years | Table 3-4 |
| **Major violations** | 2 in past 3 years | Table 5-7 |
| **Major violations** | >2 in past 3 years | Table 8+ or Decline |
| **License suspension/revocation** (non-DUI) | <1 year ago | Postpone until reinstated + 6 months |
| **License suspension/revocation** (non-DUI) | 1-3 years ago | Table 4-6 |
| **License suspension/revocation** (non-DUI) | >3 years ago | Table 2-3 |

### DUI/DWI Assessment Matrix

| Number of DUIs | Time Since Last DUI | Decision | Additional Considerations |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **1 DUI** | <1 year | Postpone | Reassess after 1 year |
| **1 DUI** | 1-3 years | Table 3-5 | Blood alcohol content (BAC) >0.15%: +1 table<br>Accident involved: +1 table<br>Injury/fatality: +2 tables or decline |
| **1 DUI** | 3-5 years | Table 2-3 | Blood alcohol content (BAC) >0.15%: +1 table<br>Accident involved: +1 table |
| **1 DUI** | >5 years | Standard to Table 2 | BAC >0.15%: consider +1 table |
| **2 DUIs** | <2 years | Postpone or Decline | Evidence of rehabilitation may allow consideration after 2 years |
| **2 DUIs** | 2-5 years | Table 4-7 | Favorable MVR since last DUI: -1 table<br>Accident involved: +1 table<br>Injury/fatality: +2 tables or decline |
| **2 DUIs** | 5-10 years | Table 3-5 | Favorable MVR since last DUI: -1 table |
| **2 DUIs** | >10 years | Table 2-3 | Favorable MVR since last DUI: consider Standard |
| **3+ DUIs** | <5 years | Decline | Not insurable |
| **3+ DUIs** | 5-10 years | Table 6-8 or Decline | Consider with strong evidence of rehabilitation |
| **3+ DUIs** | >10 years | Table 4-6 | Stable lifestyle and favorable MVR required |

### Special Considerations

1. **Chemical dependency diagnosis**: Follow substance abuse guidelines in Medical Impairments section
2. **Drug-related driving offenses**: Typically rated 1-2 tables higher than equivalent alcohol offenses
3. **Commercial drivers**: More strict assessment due to increased exposure
4. **Younger applicants (under 25)**: Add 1 table to above guidelines due to higher baseline risk
5. **Combination with other risk factors**: Evaluate cumulative impact of other lifestyle/medical risks

## Criminal History Assessment

Criminal history may indicate high-risk behaviors and lifestyle choices that impact mortality.

### Misdemeanor Offenses

| Offense Type | Time Since Completion of Sentence | Decision |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| **Non-violent, non-drug related** (trespassing, minor theft, etc.) | <1 year | Postpone until 1 year post-sentence |
| **Non-violent, non-drug related** | 1-3 years | Standard to Table 2 |
| **Non-violent, non-drug related** | >3 years | Standard |
| **Drug-related** (possession) | <2 years | Table 3-5 or postpone |
| **Drug-related** (possession) | 2-5 years | Table 2-3 |
| **Drug-related** (possession) | >5 years | Standard to Table 2 |
| **Multiple misdemeanors** (3+) | <3 years | Table 4-6 |
| **Multiple misdemeanors** (3+) | 3-5 years | Table 2-4 |
| **Multiple misdemeanors** (3+) | >5 years | Standard to Table 2 |

### Felony Offenses

| Offense Type | Time Since Completion of Sentence | Decision |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| **Non-violent, financial** (fraud, embezzlement) | <3 years | Postpone or Table 4-6 |
| **Non-violent, financial** | 3-5 years | Table 3-5 |
| **Non-violent, financial** | >5 years | Table 2-3 |
| **Drug-related** (distribution, trafficking) | <5 years | Table 6-8 or Decline |
| **Drug-related** | 5-10 years | Table 4-6 |
| **Drug-related** | >10 years | Table 2-4 |
| **Violent crimes** (assault, robbery) | <5 years | Postpone or Decline |
| **Violent crimes** | 5-10 years | Table 6-8 |
| **Violent crimes** | >10 years | Table 3-5 |
| **Multiple felonies** | <10 years | Decline |
| **Multiple felonies** | >10 years | Individual consideration |

### Special Considerations

1. **Current probation/parole**: Generally postpone until completed + 1 year
2. **Life sentence/commutation**: Generally decline
3. **Sex offenders**: Individual consideration based on registry status and time
4. **Pending charges**: Postpone until resolution

## Substance Use - Marijuana

Current marijuana usage guidelines reflect evolving legal status and research on mortality impacts.

### Recreational Marijuana Use

| Frequency | Usage Pattern | Decision |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Occasional** (<1x/month) | No nicotine use | Standard non-smoker |
| **Occasional** (<1x/month) | With nicotine use | Standard smoker |
| **Moderate** (1-8x/month) | No other risk factors | Standard non-smoker to Table 2 |
| **Moderate** (1-8x/month) | With multiple risk factors | Standard smoker to Table 3 |
| **Frequent** (>8x/month or >2x/week) | No other risk factors | Table 2-3 |
| **Frequent** (>8x/month or >2x/week) | With multiple risk factors | Table 3-5 |
| **Daily user** | No other risk factors | Table 3-4 |
| **Daily user** | With multiple risk factors | Table 4-6 |

### Medical Marijuana Use

| Underlying Condition | Usage Pattern | Decision |
|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Minor conditions** (mild anxiety, insomnia, minor pain) | As prescribed | Rate for marijuana use or underlying condition, whichever is greater |
| **Moderate conditions** (chronic pain, seizure disorders) | As prescribed | Rate for underlying condition, no additional rating for marijuana |
| **Severe conditions** (cancer, MS, severe epilepsy) | As prescribed | Rate for underlying condition, no additional rating for marijuana |

### Special Considerations

1. **CBD oil only (no THC)**: No rating if legal product
2. **Edibles vs. smoking**: Smoking may warrant +1 table due to respiratory impact
3. **Age factor**: Under 25 may warrant +1 table due to neurological development concerns
4. **Occupational considerations**: Usage in high-risk occupations may warrant additional rating
5. **Driving history**: DUI/DWI with marijuana requires rating per DUI guidelines
6. **State legality**: Illegal usage in prohibited states may indicate risk-taking behavior

## Nicotine Alternatives

Non-cigarette nicotine products have varying risk profiles compared to traditional cigarettes.

### Product-Specific Guidelines

| Product Type | Duration/Frequency | Cessation of Cigarettes | Decision |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| **E-cigarettes/Vaping** (nicotine) | Current use, any frequency | Never smoked | Standard smoker |
| **E-cigarettes/Vaping** (nicotine) | Current use, any frequency | Quit <1 year ago | Standard smoker |
| **E-cigarettes/Vaping** (nicotine) | Current use, any frequency | Quit 1-3 years ago | Standard smoker |
| **E-cigarettes/Vaping** (nicotine) | Current use, any frequency | Quit >3 years ago | Standard smoker |
| **Nicotine pouches/lozenges** | Current use, any frequency | Never smoked | Standard to Table 2 |
| **Nicotine pouches/lozenges** | Current use, any frequency | Quit >1 year ago | Standard to Table 2 |
| **Chewing tobacco/Snuff** | Current use, any frequency | Any | Standard smoker |
| **Cigars** (1-2 per month) | Occasional use, negative cotinine | Never smoked cigarettes | Standard non-smoker |
| **Cigars** (weekly use) | Regular use | Any | Standard smoker |
| **Pipes** (1-2 times per week) | Moderate use | Never smoked cigarettes | Standard to Table 2 |
| **Pipes** (daily) | Heavy use | Any | Standard smoker |

### Cessation Timeline for Non-Traditional Products

| Product Type | Time Since Cessation | Cotinine Test | Decision |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| **E-cigarettes/Vaping** | <1 year | Negative | Standard smoker |
| **E-cigarettes/Vaping** | 1-3 years | Negative | Standard non-smoker |
| **Chewing tobacco/Snuff** | <1 year | Negative | Standard smoker |
| **Chewing tobacco/Snuff** | 1-2 years | Negative | Standard non-smoker |
| **Cigars/Pipes** (regular) | <1 year | Negative | Standard non-smoker |

### Special Considerations

1. **Cotinine testing**: Primary verification method for usage
2. **Dual usage**: Rate for highest risk product if multiple forms used
3. **Recent conversion**: Caution with applicants who recently switched from cigarettes
4. **E-cigarette lung injury history**: Individual consideration based on severity
5. **Flavored products**: No rating distinction for flavor types

## Legal Risk Factors by Jurisdiction

Insurance regulations regarding the use of certain lifestyle/legal factors vary by state.

| Factor | Restricted States | Impact on Underwriting |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Marijuana use** | States with legal recreational use | May limit/prohibit rating for legal use |
| **Criminal history** | NY, CA, CT, HI, WA | Restrictions on use of certain convictions |
| **Gender identity** | CA, CO, NY, WA | Must use gender identity rather than birth sex |
| **Credit history** | CA, MA, HI | Limited use of credit in life underwriting |
| **Genetic information** | Federal (GINA) and various states | Cannot use genetic test information |
| **Travel restrictions** | CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, IL, MA, NY, WA | Limitations on rating for foreign travel |

## Required Documentation

| Factor | Documentation |
|--------|--------------|
| **DUI/DWI** | Motor Vehicle Record (MVR), DUI/DWI questionnaire, treatment records if applicable |
| **Criminal history** | Criminal history questionnaire, court records, probation/parole discharge papers |
| **Substance use** | Substance use questionnaire, medical records, laboratory testing |
| **Nicotine alternatives** | Tobacco questionnaire, cotinine testing |

## Underwriting Approach

1. **Disclosure verification**: Compare application statements with third-party data
2. **Pattern recognition**: Look for patterns of behavior rather than isolated incidents
3. **Recency and severity**: More recent and severe incidents warrant stricter underwriting
4. **Rehabilitation evidence**: Consider evidence of lifestyle changes and stability
5. **Combination effects**: Assess cumulative impact of multiple lifestyle/legal factors
