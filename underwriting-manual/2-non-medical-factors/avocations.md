# Avocations (Hobbies)

This section provides underwriting guidelines for recreational activities that may present elevated mortality risks.

## General Principles

Avocation risk assessment considers:

1. **Inherent Risk**: Nature and severity of potential hazards
2. **Frequency**: How often the activity is performed
3. **Experience**: Training, certification, and history with the activity
4. **Safety Measures**: Equipment, protocols, and precautions
5. **Environment**: Conditions under which the activity is performed

### Professional Instruction/Guiding

### Exclusion Riders

In states where permitted, exclusion riders may be offered as an alternative to flat extras for:

### Temporary vs. Permanent Ratings

For seasonal or temporary participation:
- Consider temporary flat extras that can be removed when activity ceases
