# DUI & Motor Vehicle Record Guidelines

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating driving records, with special emphasis on Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) offenses.

## Overview

Motor vehicle records provide valuable insight into an applicant's risk-taking behavior and mortality risk. Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between adverse driving history, particularly DUI/DWI offenses, and higher all-cause mortality.

Studies have shown that individuals with multiple moving violations or DUI convictions have significantly higher mortality from both vehicular and non-vehicular causes, including:
- Accidental death
- Suicide
- Liver disease
- Cardiovascular events
- Violence-related mortality

## Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) Assessment

## Drug-Related Driving Offenses

Driving under the influence of drugs, whether illicit, prescription, or cannabis:

| Scenario | Rating Adjustment |
|----------|-------------------|
| Single drug-related driving offense | Rate as DUI/DWI offense +1 table |
| Multiple drug-related driving offenses | Rate as DUI/DWI offense +2 tables |
| Mixed alcohol and drug offense | Rate as DUI/DWI offense +1 table |
| Prescription drug (legitimate use) | Rate as DUI/DWI with possible -1 table if isolated incident |

## Combined Vehicular Offenses

When multiple categories of driving infractions are present:

| Combination | Rating Approach |
|-------------|-----------------|
| DUI + major violations | Use higher of: DUI rating +1 table or Major violation rating +2 tables |
| DUI + multiple minor violations | Use higher of: DUI rating +1 table or Minor violation rating +1 table |
| Major + multiple minor violations | Use higher of: Major violation rating +1 table or Minor violation rating +2 tables |
| Multiple categories with license suspension | Add 1 table to highest applicable rating |

## Non-Driving Alcohol or Drug Offenses

When other alcohol or drug-related offenses appear on criminal record:

| Offense Type | In Combination with DUI | Rating Decision |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|

| Open container violation | With DUI history | Add 1 table to DUI rating |

## Special Considerations

### Chemical Dependency Diagnosis

| Scenario | Rating Decision |
|----------|-----------------|
| Formal alcohol dependency diagnosis + DUI | Follow Substance Abuse guidelines in Medical Impairments section |
| Formal substance use disorder + DUI | Follow Substance Abuse guidelines in Medical Impairments section |
| Alcohol treatment program attendance | May improve rating by 1 table if completed >2 years ago with no relapse |

### Commercial Drivers

| Scenario | Rating Decision |
|----------|-----------------|
| Commercial driver with DUI in personal vehicle | Standard DUI rating +1 table |
| Commercial driver with DUI in commercial vehicle | Standard DUI rating +2 tables |
| Commercial driver with multiple minor violations | Add 1 table to standard MVR rating |

### Age-Related Considerations

| 21-25 with DUI | Add 1 table to standard DUI rating |
| 26-30 with DUI | Standard DUI rating |
| Over 65 with recent DUI | Add 1 table to standard DUI rating |

## Required Documentation

| Scenario | Required Documentation |
|----------|------------------------|
| Any DUI/DWI | • Complete MVR from state of occurrence<br>• DUI/DWI questionnaire<br>• Court records if available<br>• Treatment records if applicable |
| Multiple DUIs/DWIs | • Complete MVRs from all states of licensure<br>• DUI/DWI questionnaire<br>• Court records<br>• Treatment documentation<br>• Evidence of rehabilitation<br>• Current alcohol/drug usage questionnaire |
| License suspension | • Reinstatement documentation<br>• Completion of required programs |
| DUI with injury accident | • Accident report<br>• Court disposition<br>• Restitution documentation if applicable |
| Drug-related driving offense | • Drug questionnaire<br>• Treatment documentation if applicable<br>• Prescription information if applicable |

## Underwriting Approach

### Risk Assessment Methodology

1. **Verify completeness of MVR**:
   - Check all states of residence for past 10 years
   - Verify no undisclosed incidents through application and interview process

2. **Identify patterns vs. isolated incidents**:
   - Clustered timeframe suggests period of high-risk behavior
   - Widely spaced incidents may indicate different significance
   - Progressive severity suggests escalating risk

3. **Evaluate recency**:
   - More recent incidents carry greater weight
   - Extended period (>5 years) without incidents suggests behavioral change

4. **Assess compliance**:
   - Completion of court-ordered programs
   - License reinstatement status
   - Payment of fines and restitution

5. **Consider lifestyle stability**:
   - Current alcohol/drug use patterns
   - Occupational stability
   - Residential stability

### Evidence of Rehabilitation

Factors that may improve rating decisions:

1. **Formal treatment completion**:
   - Inpatient rehabilitation program
   - Structured outpatient program
   - Ongoing participation in support groups

2. **Extended sobriety**:
   - Documented abstinence from alcohol/drugs
   - Clean random testing if available

3. **License restoration**:
   - Completion of required programs
   - Interlock device compliance if applicable

4. **Clean driving record**:
   - Extended period without any moving violations
   - Voluntary defensive driving courses

5. **Life stability indicators**:
   - Stable employment
   - Stable residence
   - Positive family support

## State-Specific Considerations

| State | Special Requirements/Considerations |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| **California** | Court notification requirements for alcohol-related offenses |
| **Florida** | FR-44 insurance filing for DUI offenders |
| **Illinois** | Mandatory high-risk insurance for multiple offenders |
| **New York** | Look-back period of 10 years for DUI history |
| **Michigan** | Distinguishes Operating While Intoxicated (OWI) vs. Operating While Visibly Impaired (OWVI) |

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

- MVRs are regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- Applicants must be notified of adverse actions based on MVR information
- State insurance departments may have specific guidelines for DUI rating
- Some states prohibit DUI rating for incidents beyond a certain age
