# Financial Underwriting

Financial underwriting ensures that the proposed life insurance amount is reasonable and justified based on the applicant's financial situation and insurance needs.

## Purpose of Financial Underwriting

1. **Prevent Over-Insurance**: Ensure coverage amounts are reasonable relative to financial loss
2. **Detect Anti-Selection**: Identify cases where insurance is being purchased for speculation
3. **Prevent Moral Hazard**: Avoid creating situations where beneficiaries benefit excessively from death
4. **Ensure Affordability**: Confirm the applicant can afford the premium payments
5. **Verify Insurable Interest**: Confirm legitimate economic interest in the insured's life
