# Foreign Travel & Residency

This document outlines the underwriting approach for foreign travel and residency factors that may impact mortality and insurance risk.

## Overview

Foreign travel and residency can expose individuals to health, safety, and political risks that may vary significantly from domestic exposures. Underwriting these risks requires assessment of destination-specific factors including:

- Political stability
- Healthcare infrastructure
- Endemic disease prevalence
- Regional violence and crime rates
- Natural disaster risk
- Travel purpose and duration
- Living conditions

## Travel Risk Categories

Based on a comprehensive assessment of mortality factors, countries are categorized into risk tiers that drive underwriting decisions.

### Country Risk Tier System

| Risk Tier | Description | Examples | General Approach |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Low risk; comparable to domestic | Canada, UK, Australia, Japan, Western Europe | Standard rates for most travel |
| **Tier 2** | Moderate risk; generally acceptable | Mexico (tourist areas), Brazil (major cities), Thailand, Malaysia | Standard to Table 2 depending on specifics |
| **Tier 3** | Elevated risk; case-by-case evaluation | Russia, Philippines, India, China (rural), Egypt | Table 2-4 or flat extras $2-5 per $1,000 |
| **Tier 4** | High risk; significant concerns | Pakistan, Venezuela, Nigeria, Kenya | Table 4-6, flat extras $5-10 per $1,000, or decline |
| **Tier 5** | Severe risk; generally uninsurable | Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Korea | Decline or postpone |

### Special Designation Areas

| Designation | Source | Underwriting Implication |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Level 4: Do Not Travel** | US State Department | Typically decline or postpone |
| **Level 3: Reconsider Travel** | US State Department | Typically Table 4+ or flat extra |

## Required Documentation

| Scenario | Documentation |
|----------|--------------|
| **Frequent travel to Tier 3-5 countries** | Foreign travel questionnaire, itineraries, purpose of travel |
| **Extended stays (>30 days) in Tier 3-5** | Foreign travel questionnaire, visa information, residential address, local emergency contacts |
| **Temporary foreign residency** | Foreign residency questionnaire, visa/work permit status, residential details, expected duration, evacuation plans |
| **Permanent foreign residency** | Foreign residency questionnaire, citizenship/residency status, ties to US/Canada, local insurance options |
| **Missionary/humanitarian work** | Organization details, security protocols, evacuation arrangements, specific work locations and duties |

## Special Considerations

### Factors That May Improve Ratings

1. **Corporate security measures**: Established protocols, secure accommodations, evacuation arrangements
2. **Restricted travel zones**: Remaining in low-risk areas of otherwise high-risk countries (e.g., tourist zones, major cities)
3. **Access to quality healthcare**: International hospitals, evacuation insurance
4. **Regular return to US/Canada**: Frequent returns decrease exposure
5. **Purpose of travel**: Business travel to established facilities may have lower risk than tourism to remote areas

### Factors That May Worsen Ratings

1. **Remote locations**: Travel to areas far from adequate medical facilities
2. **High-risk activities**: Adventure travel, missionary work in conflict zones
3. **Extended duration**: Longer stays increase exposure to risks
4. **Frequent travel to multiple high-risk regions**: Cumulative exposure
5. **History of previous health issues while traveling abroad**: Indicates vulnerability

## Regulatory Constraints

Several states limit insurers' ability to consider foreign travel in underwriting decisions:

| State | Restriction Level | Impact on Underwriting |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|
| California | Severe | Cannot rate or decline based on lawful foreign travel |
| Colorado | Severe | Cannot rate or decline based on lawful foreign travel |
| Connecticut | Moderate | Limited ability to rate based on travel |
| Florida | Moderate | Limited ability to rate based on travel |
| Georgia | Moderate | Restrictions on travel underwriting |
| Illinois | Moderate | Restrictions on travel underwriting |
| Massachusetts | Moderate | Limited ability to rate based on travel |
| New York | Severe | Cannot rate or decline based on past or future lawful travel |
| Washington | Moderate | Restrictions on travel underwriting |

In jurisdictions with restrictions, underwriting should focus on other risk factors and comply with local regulations.

## Updating Risk Assessments

Country risk tiers are updated quarterly based on:

1. US State Department travel advisories
2. World Health Organization alerts
3. United Nations security assessments
4. Political stability indices
5. Healthcare quality metrics
6. Natural disaster data
7. Crime statistics

Significant deterioration in a country's security situation may result in immediate risk tier changes outside the regular update schedule.
