# Marijuana Usage Guidelines

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals who use marijuana in any form.

## Overview

The underwriting approach to marijuana use has evolved significantly in recent years due to:
- Changing legal status across many jurisdictions
- Expanded research on health impacts
- Differentiation between recreational and medical use
- Variety of consumption methods and their distinct risk profiles
- Better understanding of usage patterns and associated behaviors

Current underwriting philosophy aims to balance actuarial evidence of mortality risk with recognition of marijuana's increasingly accepted legal status and medical applications.

## Usage Patterns and Definitions

| Usage Category | Definition | Examples |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Occasional use** | Less than once per month | Social use at gatherings |
| **Moderate use** | 1-8 times per month | Weekend use |
| **Frequent use** | >8 times per month but not daily | Regular but not daily use |
| **Daily use** | One or more times per day | Consistent daily user |
| **Heavy use** | Multiple times daily | Throughout-the-day usage |
| **Medical use** | Under physician recommendation | For qualifying medical conditions |

## Recreational Marijuana Use Guidelines

| **Occasional** (<1x/month) | Any | Standard non-smoker | Standard non-smoker to Table 2 |
| **Moderate** (1-8x/month) | Smoking | Standard non-smoker to Table 2 | Table 2-3 |

### Smoker Status Determination

| Scenario | Smoker Classification |
|----------|------------------------|
| Marijuana smoking only, no tobacco | Non-smoker rates with possible table rating* |
| Marijuana smoking + tobacco | Smoker rates |
| Marijuana edibles/vaporizing only | Non-smoker rates with possible table rating* |
| Marijuana edibles + tobacco smoking | Smoker rates |

*Table rating based on frequency and other factors per rating chart

## Medical Marijuana Use Guidelines

### Qualifying Medical Conditions Rating Approach

| Qualifying Condition Category | Examples | Marijuana Usage Rating | Underlying Condition Rating |
|-------------------------------|----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Minor conditions** | Mild insomnia, mild anxiety, non-chronic pain | Per recreational use schedule | Per condition schedule |
| **Moderate conditions** | Chronic pain, muscle spasms, migraines | No additional rating for marijuana | Per condition schedule |
| **Severe conditions** | Epilepsy, MS, cancer-related symptoms | No additional rating for marijuana | Per condition schedule |
| **Terminal conditions** | Advanced cancer, end-stage illnesses | No additional rating for marijuana | Per condition schedule |

### Documentation Requirements

| Medical Marijuana Scenario | Required Documentation |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Any medical marijuana use | • Physician recommendation/prescription<br>• Diagnosis verification<br>• Treatment history for underlying condition<br>• Usage pattern disclosure (frequency, method, amount)<br>• Current provider documentation |
| Severe or complex conditions | • Specialist records<br>• All treatments tried for condition<br>• Functional status assessment |

## Modifying Factors

### Unfavorable Factors (May Increase Rating)

| Factor | Potential Rating Adjustment | Documentation Required |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|
