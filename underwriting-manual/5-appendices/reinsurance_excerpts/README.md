# Reinsurance Excerpts

This section provides key excerpts from reinsurance treaties and guidelines that impact the underwriting process. These references are intended to help underwriters understand reinsurance requirements and the process for submitting cases to reinsurers.

## Included Documents

- [Treaty Summary](treaty_summary.md): Key provisions from the automatic reinsurance treaty that affect underwriting decisions.
- [Facultative Guidelines](facultative_guidelines.md): Procedures and requirements for submitting cases for facultative consideration.
- [Reinsurer Requirements](reinsurer_requirements.md): Specific evidence and documentation requirements from our reinsurance partners.

## Purpose of Reinsurance Excerpts

These excerpts serve several critical purposes:

1. **Compliance**: Ensure underwriting decisions align with reinsurance treaty requirements.
2. **Retention Management**: Guide underwriters on when cases must be ceded or facultatively submitted.
3. **Process Standardization**: Establish consistent procedures for reinsurance submissions.
4. **Risk Management**: Support appropriate risk assessment for cases approaching or exceeding automatic binding limits.

## Important Considerations

- Reinsurance requirements may differ from our standard underwriting guidelines in some cases.
- Treaty terms supersede standard underwriting guidelines when applicable.
- Automatic binding limits and jumbo limits must be strictly observed.
- Special classes of risk may have specific reinsurance requirements or limitations.
- Facultative submission requirements and timelines are contractually binding.

## Using These References

Underwriters should refer to these resources when:

- Handling cases near or above retention limits
- Evaluating complex or unusual risks
- Determining whether facultative reinsurance is needed
- Preparing cases for reinsurer review
- Evaluating cases with unusual or non-standard provisions
