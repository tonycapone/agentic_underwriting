# Facultative Reinsurance Guidelines

This document outlines the procedures and requirements for submitting cases for facultative reinsurance consideration. Facultative reinsurance is used when a case falls outside automatic treaty provisions or requires individual consideration by the reinsurer.

Cases must be submitted for facultative consideration in the following circumstances:

1. Face amount exceeds automatic binding limits
2. Proposed insured has an impairment specifically excluded from automatic coverage
3. Proposed rating exceeds treaty maximum (Table 16)
4. Jumbo limit is exceeded by total in-force and applied-for coverage
5. Special risk case requiring specialized underwriting expertise
6. Case involves unusual policy provisions not covered by the treaty
7. Any other circumstance where the case falls outside automatic treaty provisions

1. Document the reinsurer's decision in the case file
2. Complete Reinsurance Cession Form
3. Process the policy according to normal procedures
4. Send notification of placement to the reinsurer

### Decline or Modified Offer

If the case is declined or modified by the reinsurer:

1. Review the reinsurer's rationale
2. Consider alternative reinsurers if appropriate
3. Determine if the case can be approved with company retention only
4. Communicate decision to the agent/applicant
5. Document all decisions in the case file

## Shopping Cases

The following guidelines apply to shopping cases with multiple reinsurers:

1. Disclose to all reinsurers that the case is being shopped
2. Submit identical information to all reinsurers
3. Do not share one reinsurer's decision with other reinsurers
4. Document all offers and decisions
5. Select the most favorable valid offer

## Best Practices

2. Provide clear explanations of unusual situations
3. Include your recommendation and rationale
4. Follow up on pending cases weekly
5. Document all communications with reinsurers
6. Develop relationships with reinsurer underwriters
7. Review declined cases for learning opportunities
