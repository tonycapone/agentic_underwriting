# Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)

## Definition & Classification

**Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)/Willis–Ekbom Disease**: A neurological sensorimotor disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, that begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movement, and is worse in the evening or at night. May be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (e.g., iron deficiency, pregnancy, CKD, neuropathy).

### Diagnostic Criteria (International RLS Study Group)

1. Urge to move the legs, usually with unpleasant sensations
2. Symptoms begin/worsen during rest or inactivity
3. Symptoms are relieved by movement
4. Symptoms are worse in the evening/night than during the day
5. Not solely accounted for by another condition (e.g., leg cramps, positional discomfort)

### Severity Scales

- International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS): Mild (1–10), Moderate (11–20), Severe (21–30), Very Severe (31–40)
- Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI) from polysomnography when available

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Clinician diagnosis with IRLSSG criteria
   - Onset date, frequency, and severity (IRLS score if available)
   - Daytime impairment and sleep disruption

2. **Contributing conditions**:
   - Iron status (ferritin, transferrin saturation)
   - CKD, pregnancy history, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes
   - Medications that may worsen RLS (antihistamines, SSRIs/SNRIs, antipsychotics)

3. **Treatment details**:
   - Non-pharmacologic: sleep hygiene, exercise timing, caffeine/alcohol/nicotine reduction
   - Iron supplementation: route, duration, response
   - Pharmacologic therapy: agent(s), dose, duration, response, side effects
     - Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine)
     - Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, pregabalin)
     - Others (benzodiazepines as adjunct, opioids for refractory cases)
   - Documentation of augmentation or impulse-control disorders with dopamine agonists

4. **Functional impact**:
   - Work performance, absenteeism
   - Driving safety and daytime sleepiness
   - Quality-of-life impact

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Sleep specialist evaluation and polysomnography (if performed)
- Neurology consultation notes for secondary causes
- Documentation of refractory RLS management (combination therapy, opioid rotation)

## Rating Guidelines

### Uncomplicated/Mild RLS

| Severity | Treatment | Stability | Rating |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Mild (IRLS ≤10), minimal daytime impact | Lifestyle ± iron repletion | ≥6 months | Standard |
| Mild–Moderate (IRLS 11–20), improved | Alpha-2-delta ligand or dopamine agonist | ≥6 months | Standard to +25 points |

### Moderate to Severe RLS

| Severity/Complication | Treatment Response | Stability | Rating |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| Moderate (IRLS 11–20) with residual symptoms | On monotherapy | <6 months | +25 to +50 points |
| Severe (IRLS 21–30) controlled | On stable regimen | ≥12 months | +25 to +50 points |
| Severe with frequent nocturnal awakenings | Incomplete response | Any | +50 to +75 points |
| Very severe (IRLS >30) or refractory | Multiple agents | Any | +75 to +100 points |

### Special Situations

| Situation | Details | Rating |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Augmentation on dopamine agonist | Dose escalation, earlier onset, symptom spread | +25 to +50 points; consider switch to alpha-2-delta agent |
| Comorbid OSA untreated | Excessive daytime sleepiness | Postpone until OSA addressed; rate per OSA thereafter |
| Iron deficiency (ferritin <75 ng/mL) untreated | Active symptoms | Postpone until iron repletion initiated and reassessment |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Recent initiation or change of RLS therapy (<3 months)
2. Suspected but unevaluated secondary cause (e.g., iron deficiency, OSA, CKD)
3. Excessive daytime sleepiness with drowsy-driving incidents pending evaluation

### Decline

1. Recurrent motor vehicle accidents attributable to sleepiness in the past 2 years
2. Severe refractory RLS on high-risk polypharmacy with unsafe daytime somnolence

## Medication Considerations

| Class | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|------|----------|---------------------------|
| Alpha-2-delta ligands | Gabapentin, Pregabalin | Often preferred; favorable profile |
| Dopamine agonists | Pramipexole, Ropinirole, Rotigotine | Effective; monitor augmentation/impulse-control disorders |
| Iron supplementation | Oral or IV iron | Favorable; treat underlying deficiency |
| Adjuncts | Clonazepam, Low-dose opioids (refractory) | Consider sedation, dependence risks |

## Comorbidity Factors

| Comorbidity | Rating Adjustment |
|------------|-------------------|
| Obstructive sleep apnea | Rate per OSA; postpone if untreated and symptomatic |
| Chronic kidney disease | Add +25 to +50 points based on stage; consider secondary RLS |
| Peripheral neuropathy/diabetes | Add +25 points; evaluate pain and function |
| Depression/anxiety | Rate per condition; add 0 to +25 points if RLS persists |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Symptom control**:
   - IRLS improvement to mild or remission
   - Stable regimen ≥6–12 months without augmentation
   - No daytime sleepiness incidents

2. **Addressing contributors**:
   - Ferritin ≥75–100 ng/mL and TSat ≥20–25%
   - Treatment of OSA, CKD-related anemia, or neuropathy

3. **Risk mitigation**:
   - Avoid sedatives when possible
   - Driving safety counseling and absence of incidents
