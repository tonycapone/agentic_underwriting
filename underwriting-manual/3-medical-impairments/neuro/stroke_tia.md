# Stroke & Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

## Definition & Classification

**Stroke**: A sudden interruption in the blood supply to the brain, causing neurological deficits that persist for at least 24 hours or lead to death. Strokes are broadly classified as ischemic (due to blockage of blood vessels) or hemorrhagic (due to bleeding).

**Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**: A brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour and without evidence of acute infarction on imaging.

### Classification Systems

**By Mechanism**:
- **Ischemic Stroke** (87% of cases):
  - Large-artery atherosclerosis
  - Cardioembolism
  - Small-vessel occlusion (lacunar)
  - Other determined etiology
  - Undetermined etiology (cryptogenic)

- **Hemorrhagic Stroke** (13% of cases):
  - Intracerebral hemorrhage
  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage

**By Severity**:
- **NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)**:
  - Minor stroke: 1-4
  - Moderate stroke: 5-15
  - Moderate to severe stroke: 16-20
  - Severe stroke: 21-42

**By Functional Outcome**:
- **Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)**:
  - 0: No symptoms
  - 1: No significant disability
  - 2: Slight disability
  - 3: Moderate disability
  - 4: Moderately severe disability
  - 5: Severe disability
  - 6: Death

   - Weight management
   - Regular physical activity

3. **Treatment compliance**:
   - Consistent use of antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy
   - Regular medical follow-up
   - Adherence to all preventive medications

4. **Functional recovery**:
