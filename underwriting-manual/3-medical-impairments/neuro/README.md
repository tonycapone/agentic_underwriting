# Neurological Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting neurological conditions, including:

## Common Neurological Conditions

- [Stroke & Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)](stroke_tia.md): Disruption of blood flow to the brain resulting in neurological deficits.
- [Epilepsy](epilepsy.md): Neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures of various types and severity.
- [Multiple Sclerosis (MS)](multiple_sclerosis.md): Autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system with demyelination and neurodegeneration.
- [Parkinson's Disease](parkinsons.md): Progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement and non-motor functions.
- [Dementia](dementia.md): Progressive decline in cognitive function affecting memory, reasoning, and other cognitive domains.
- [Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)](restless_legs_syndrome.md): Sensorimotor disorder causing an urge to move the legs, often disrupting sleep.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and classification**: Specific condition, subtype, and diagnostic certainty
2. **Disease duration and progression**: Time since onset and rate of progression
3. **Severity**: Functional impairment, disability scales, and impact on activities of daily living
4. **Treatment regimen**: Medications, therapies, surgical interventions, and response to treatment
5. **Complications**: Secondary conditions, falls, respiratory issues, cognitive decline
6. **Risk factors**: Age, family history, comorbidities, lifestyle factors
7. **Monitoring and follow-up**: Frequency of specialist visits and compliance with monitoring

## Evidence Requirements

- Neurologist consultation reports
- Diagnostic tests (MRI, CT, EEG, EMG, lumbar puncture results)
- Functional assessment scales (EDSS for MS, Hoehn and Yahr for Parkinson's, etc.)
- Cognitive assessments (for dementia, cognitive impairment)
- Seizure frequency logs (for epilepsy)
- Current medication list and treatment history
- History of hospitalizations related to neurological conditions

## General Approach

Neurological conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, severity, progression, functional impact, and treatment response. Ratings range from standard to mild ratings for well-controlled, stable conditions with minimal functional impact to significant ratings or decline for progressive, debilitating disease with significant functional impairment.
