# Parkinson's Disease

## Definition & Classification

**Parkinson's Disease (PD)**: A progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms including bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. PD results from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain.

### Classification Systems

**Hoehn and Yahr Scale**:
- **Stage 1**: Unilateral involvement only
- **Stage 2**: Bilateral involvement without impairment of balance
- **Stage 3**: Mild to moderate bilateral disease with some postural instability; physically independent
- **Stage 4**: Severe disability, but still able to walk or stand unassisted
- **Stage 5**: Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided

**Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)**:
- Part I: Non-motor experiences of daily living
- Part II: Motor experiences of daily living
- Part III: Motor examination
- Part IV: Motor complications

**Clinical Subtypes**:
- **Tremor-dominant**: Characterized primarily by tremor with minimal other symptoms
- **Akinetic-rigid**: Characterized primarily by bradykinesia and rigidity
- **Mixed**: Combination of tremor and akinetic-rigid features
- **Postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD)**: Characterized primarily by balance and walking problems

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Neurologist's diagnosis and notes

3. **Treatment information**:
   - Current medications and dosages
   - Response to treatment
   - Medication side effects
   - Surgical interventions (if any)

## Special Considerations

### Parkinsonism vs. Parkinson's Disease

| Condition | Distinguishing Features | Rating Approach |

| **Corticobasal Degeneration** | Asymmetric rigidity, apraxia, alien limb | +150 to +200 points or higher; often Decline |

### Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)

| Time Since Surgery | Outcome | Rating |
|-------------------|---------|--------|
| <6 months | Any | Postpone |
| 6-12 months | Excellent response | Base PD rating +25 points |
| 6-12 months | Good response | Base PD rating +50 points |
| 6-12 months | Poor response | Base PD rating +75 points |
| >12 months | Excellent response | Base PD rating |
| >12 months | Good response | Base PD rating +25 points |
| >12 months | Poor response | Base PD rating +50 points |

**Response Definitions**:
- Excellent: >70% improvement in motor symptoms
- Good: 30-70% improvement in motor symptoms
- Poor: <30% improvement in motor symptoms

### Young-Onset Parkinson's Disease (YOPD)

For cases with onset before age 40:
- Often genetic forms
- Slower progression
- Better response to levodopa
- More motor complications
- Less cognitive impairment

Consider individual assessment with neurologist input.

### Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) vs. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)

| Timing of Cognitive Symptoms | Rating Approach |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Cognitive symptoms >1 year after motor symptoms (PDD) | Rate as PD with cognitive complication |
| Cognitive symptoms before or within 1 year of motor symptoms (DLB) | Rate using dementia guidelines; generally higher ratings or Decline |
