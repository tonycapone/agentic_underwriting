# Epilepsy

## Definition & Classification

**Epilepsy**: A chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures resulting from abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy is diagnosed when a person has two or more unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, or one unprovoked seizure with a high risk of recurrence.

### Classification Systems

**International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification**:

**Seizure Types**:
- **Focal Seizures** (originating in one hemisphere):
  - Focal aware seizures (previously simple partial)
  - Focal impaired awareness seizures (previously complex partial)
  - Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (previously secondarily generalized)

- **Generalized Seizures** (involving both hemispheres):
  - Absence seizures
  - Myoclonic seizures
  - Tonic seizures
  - Clonic seizures
  - Tonic-clonic seizures
  - Atonic seizures

**Epilepsy Types**:
- **Focal Epilepsy**
- **Generalized Epilepsy**
- **Combined Generalized and Focal Epilepsy**
- **Unknown Epilepsy**

**Etiological Categories**:
- **Structural**: Due to structural abnormalities (stroke, tumor, trauma, etc.)
- **Genetic**: Direct result of genetic defect(s)
- **Infectious**: Result of a known infection
- **Metabolic**: Result of known metabolic or immune disorders
- **Immune**: Associated with autoimmune disorders
- **Unknown**: Cause not determined

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Category | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **First-generation AEDs** | Phenytoin (Dilantin), Carbamazepine (Tegretol), Valproic acid (Depakote), Phenobarbital | Older medications, may indicate long-standing epilepsy; monitor for side effects |
| **Second-generation AEDs** | Lamotrigine (Lamictal), Levetiracetam (Keppra), Topiramate (Topamax), Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) | Generally better tolerated; common first-line choices |
| **Newer AEDs** | Lacosamide (Vimpat), Perampanel (Fycompa), Brivaracetam (Briviact), Eslicarbazepine (Aptiom) | May indicate more difficult-to-control epilepsy or intolerance to other medications |
| **Multiple AEDs** | Combination therapy | Indicates more difficult-to-control epilepsy |
| **Rescue Medications** | Diazepam (Valium), Midazolam (Versed), Lorazepam (Ativan) | For emergency seizure control; frequent use indicates poor control |
