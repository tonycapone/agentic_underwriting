# Multiple Sclerosis

## Definition & Classification

**Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**: A chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body. MS is characterized by the development of lesions in the brain and spinal cord, leading to a wide range of neurological symptoms.

### Classification Systems

**Clinical Course Patterns**:

- **Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS)**: Clearly defined relapses with full recovery or residual deficit upon recovery; periods between relapses characterized by lack of disease progression. Approximately 85% of MS patients are initially diagnosed with RRMS.

- **Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS)**: Initial relapsing-remitting course followed by progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, and plateaus. About 60-70% of RRMS patients eventually transition to SPMS.

- **Primary Progressive MS (PPMS)**: Disease progression from onset with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. Approximately 10-15% of patients have PPMS.

- **Progressive-Relapsing MS (PRMS)**: Progressive disease from onset, with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery; periods between relapses characterized by continuing progression. This is the least common form (<5%).

**Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)**:

- 0.0: Normal neurological examination
- 1.0-4.5: Fully ambulatory despite moderate disability
- 5.0-7.5: Impaired walking but able to walk with assistance
- 8.0-9.5: Essentially restricted to bed or chair
- 10.0: Death due to MS

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Neurologist's diagnosis and notes
   - MRI reports showing characteristic lesions
   - Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (if performed)
   - Evoked potential studies (if performed)

2. **Disease characteristics**:
   - Date of diagnosis
   - Clinical course pattern (RRMS, SPMS, PPMS, PRMS)
   - Frequency and severity of relapses
   - EDSS score (if available)

3. **Treatment information**:
   - Current disease-modifying therapies
   - Symptomatic treatments
   - Response to treatment
   - Medication compliance

4. **Functional status**:
   - Mobility assessment
   - Activities of daily living
   - Cognitive function
   - Employment status

5. **Progression indicators**:
   - Recent MRI findings (new/enlarging lesions)
   - Changes in neurological examination
   - Progression of disability

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Detailed neuropsychological testing
- Quantitative MRI metrics (brain volume, lesion load)
- Optical coherence tomography
- Specialist consultation reports

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Category | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Injectable Disease-Modifying Therapies** | Interferon beta (Avonex, Rebif, Betaseron), Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) | First-line therapies, generally favorable if stable |
| **Oral Disease-Modifying Therapies** | Fingolimod (Gilenya), Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), Teriflunomide (Aubagio) | May indicate more active disease or progression from injectables |
| **High-Efficacy Infusion Therapies** | Natalizumab (Tysabri), Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) | May indicate more aggressive disease or treatment failure with other agents |
| **Symptomatic Treatments** | Baclofen, Tizanidine, Dalfampridine, Modafinil | Assess based on symptoms being treated |
| **Relapse Treatments** | Corticosteroids, ACTH, Plasmapheresis | Recent use may indicate active disease |

## Special Considerations

### Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)

| MRI Findings | Time Since Event | Points |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| No lesions | <1 year | +25 to +50 points |
| No lesions | >1 year | Standard to +25 points |
| 1-2 lesions | <1 year | +50 to +75 points |
| 1-2 lesions | >1 year | +25 to +50 points |
| >2 lesions | <1 year | +75 to +100 points |
| >2 lesions | >1 year | +50 to +75 points |

### Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS)

| Risk Factors | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Low risk (few lesions, no infratentorial/spinal lesions) | Standard to +25 points |
| Moderate risk | +25 to +50 points |
| High risk (multiple lesions, infratentorial/spinal involvement) | +50 to +75 points |

### Benign MS

For cases with:
- >15 years since diagnosis
- EDSS ≤3.0
- Minimal progression
- Fully functional

Consider: +25 to +75 points based on individual assessment

### Pediatric-Onset MS

| Current Age | Years Since Diagnosis | Disease Activity | Points |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------|--------|
| <25 | <5 | Active | +100 to +150 points |
| <25 | <5 | Stable | +75 to +125 points |
| <25 | >5 | Active | +75 to +125 points |
| <25 | >5 | Stable | +50 to +100 points |
| >25 | >10 | Stable | Rate as adult MS |

### Pregnancy Considerations

- MS often stabilizes during pregnancy
- Increased relapse risk in postpartum period
- Consider postponing new applications until 6 months postpartum
