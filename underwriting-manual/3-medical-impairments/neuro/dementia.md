# Dementia

## Definition & Classification

**Dementia**: A syndrome characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and independence. Dementia involves impairment in memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment.

### Classification Systems

**By Etiology**:
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Most common form (60-70% of cases), characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
- **Vascular Dementia**: Second most common form, resulting from cerebrovascular disease
- **Lewy Body Dementia**: Characterized by abnormal protein deposits (Lewy bodies) in nerve cells
- **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Characterized by progressive damage to the frontal and/or temporal lobes
- **Mixed Dementia**: Combination of two or more types, most commonly Alzheimer's and vascular
- **Other causes**: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, traumatic brain injury, HIV, etc.

**By Severity**:
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**: Cognitive decline greater than expected for age but not interfering significantly with daily activities
- **Mild Dementia**: Noticeable impairment in cognitive functions, but still able to perform basic activities of daily living
- **Moderate Dementia**: Significant impairment requiring some assistance with daily activities
- **Severe Dementia**: Profound impairment requiring extensive or complete assistance with daily activities

**Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale**:
- **0**: No dementia
- **0.5**: Very mild dementia (often equivalent to MCI)
- **1**: Mild dementia
- **2**: Moderate dementia
- **3**: Severe dementia
