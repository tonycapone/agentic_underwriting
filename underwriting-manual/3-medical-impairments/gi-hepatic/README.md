# Gastrointestinal & Hepatic Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting gastrointestinal and hepatic conditions, including:

## Common GI & Hepatic Conditions

- [Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)](ibd.md): Chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
- [Cirrhosis](cirrhosis.md): Late stage of scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by various liver diseases and conditions.
- [Hepatitis B & C](hepatitis_bc.md): Viral infections that attack the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.
- [Bariatric Surgery](bariatric_surgery.md): Weight loss surgeries that alter the digestive system to help lose weight and improve metabolic health.
- [Elevated Liver Enzymes](elevated_liver_enzymes.md): Evaluation and rating guidance for abnormal ALT/AST/ALP/GGT/bilirubin.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and classification**: Specific condition, severity, and extent of involvement
2. **Disease activity**: Active, remission, or relapsing-remitting pattern
3. **Treatment regimen**: Medications, surgical interventions, and response to treatment
4. **Complications**: Primary disease complications or treatment-related complications
5. **Laboratory values**: Liver function tests, inflammatory markers, nutritional parameters
6. **Comorbidities**: Associated conditions such as autoimmune disorders, metabolic issues
7. **Lifestyle factors**: Alcohol use, diet, weight stability

## Evidence Requirements

- Specialist consultation reports (gastroenterology, hepatology)
- Endoscopy, colonoscopy, or imaging results
- Laboratory test results (liver function tests, hepatitis serology, inflammatory markers)
- Biopsy results or pathology reports
- Surgical reports for any GI procedures
- Current medication list and treatment history
- History of hospitalizations related to GI/hepatic conditions

## General Approach

Gastrointestinal and hepatic conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, disease activity, complications, and impact on overall functioning. Ratings range from standard for well-controlled conditions with minimal disease activity to significant ratings or decline for advanced disease with complications or poor prognosis.
