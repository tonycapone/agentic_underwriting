# Bariatric Surgery Follow-up

## Definition & Classification

**Bariatric Surgery**: Surgical procedures performed on the stomach and/or intestines to induce weight loss for the treatment of severe obesity and related comorbidities.

### Types of Bariatric Procedures

**Restrictive Procedures** (limit food intake):
- **Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding (LAGB)**: Placement of an adjustable band around the upper part of the stomach
- **Sleeve Gastrectomy**: Removal of approximately 80% of the stomach, leaving a tube-like "sleeve"
- **Gastric Balloon**: Temporary placement of a silicone balloon in the stomach to reduce space for food (non-surgical, temporary)

**Malabsorptive Procedures** (limit nutrient absorption):
- **Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD)**: Removal of part of the stomach and bypassing a significant portion of the small intestine
- **Duodenal Switch (DS)**: Variant of BPD with vertical sleeve gastrectomy and duodenal-ileal anastomosis

**Combined Procedures**:
- **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)**: Creation of a small stomach pouch connected to the middle part of the small intestine
- **Mini-Gastric Bypass**: Simplified version of RYGB with a single anastomosis
- **Single Anastomosis Duodeno-Ileal Bypass with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SADI-S)**: Simplified version of duodenal switch

**Reversible vs. Permanent**:
- **Reversible**: LAGB, gastric balloon (temporary by design)
- **Potentially Reversible**: RYGB (though complex to reverse)
- **Permanent**: Sleeve gastrectomy, BPD, duodenal switch

### Post-Surgical Phases

**Early Post-Operative Phase**: 0-3 months
- Liquid to pureed to soft diet progression
- Highest risk of surgical complications
- Initial rapid weight loss

**Active Weight Loss Phase**: 3-18 months
- Continued weight loss at decreasing rate
- Dietary stabilization
- Nutritional monitoring

**Weight Maintenance Phase**: >18 months
- Stabilization of weight
- Long-term follow-up
- Management of any complications or nutritional deficiencies

## Required Evidence

| **Iron** | High in RYGB, BPD/DS | Every 3-6 months initially, then annually | Deficiency common; severe anemia concerning |
| **Vitamin D & Calcium** | High in all malabsorptive procedures | Every 6-12 months | Deficiency suggests poor supplementation; bone health concerns |
| **Protein** | Very high in BPD/DS | Regular assessment | Severe deficiency serious concern for BPD/DS |
| **Folate** | Moderate in malabsorptive procedures | Annually | Deficiency uncommon with proper supplementation |
| **Fat-soluble vitamins (A,E,K)** | High in BPD/DS | Every 6-12 months for BPD/DS | Deficiencies suggest poor compliance or severe malabsorption |
| **Thiamine** | Risk with rapid weight loss or vomiting | As needed | Acute deficiency requires immediate intervention |
| **Zinc and Copper** | Moderate in malabsorptive procedures | Annually | Balance important; excess zinc can cause copper deficiency |
