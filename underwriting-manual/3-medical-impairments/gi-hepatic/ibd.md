# Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

## Definition & Classification

**Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**: A group of chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by periods of active disease (flares) alternating with periods of remission.

### Primary Types

- **Crohn's Disease (CD)**: Inflammation can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, but most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon. Characterized by transmural inflammation (affecting all layers of the bowel wall) and skip lesions (affected areas interspersed with normal bowel).

- **Ulcerative Colitis (UC)**: Inflammation limited to the colon and rectum, affecting only the innermost lining (mucosa) and spreading continuously from the rectum proximally.

### Classification Systems

**Crohn's Disease - Montreal Classification**:
- **Age at Diagnosis (A)**:
  - A1: â‰¤16 years
  - A2: 17-40 years
  - A3: >40 years
- **Location (L)**:
  - L1: Terminal ileum
  - L2: Colon
  - L3: Ileocolon
  - L4: Upper GI (modifier)
- **Behavior (B)**:
  - B1: Non-stricturing, non-penetrating
  - B2: Stricturing
  - B3: Penetrating
  - p: Perianal disease modifier

**Ulcerative Colitis - Extent**:
- **E1**: Ulcerative proctitis (limited to rectum)
- **E2**: Left-sided colitis (distal to splenic flexure)
- **E3**: Extensive colitis/pancolitis (extends proximal to splenic flexure)

**Disease Severity**:
- **Mild**: Minimal symptoms, normal activities
- **Moderate**: More frequent symptoms, some interference with activities
- **Severe**: Significant symptoms, marked interference with activities
- **Fulminant**: Severe symptoms requiring hospitalization

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

3. **Treatment information**:
   - Current medications and dosages
   - Duration of current treatment
   - Previous medication trials

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Category | Examples | Underwriting Significance |

| **Corticosteroids** | Prednisone, Budesonide | Short-term use acceptable; chronic use suggests poor control |
| **Immunomodulators** | Azathioprine, 6-MP, Methotrexate | Indicates moderate-severe disease requiring immune suppression |
| **Biologics - Anti-TNF** | Infliximab (Remicade), Adalimumab (Humira) | Indicates moderate-severe disease; good response favorable |
| **Biologics - Anti-Integrin** | Vedolizumab (Entyvio) | Indicates moderate-severe disease; gut-selective action |
| **Biologics - Anti-IL-12/23** | Ustekinumab (Stelara) | Indicates moderate-severe disease |
| **Biologics - JAK Inhibitors** | Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) | Indicates moderate-severe UC; newer therapy |
| **Antibiotics** | Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole | May indicate complications (abscess, perianal disease) |
| **Multiple Medications** | Combination therapy | Indicates more difficult-to-treat disease |
