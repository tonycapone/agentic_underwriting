# Elevated Liver Enzymes (Transaminitis/Cholestatic Pattern)

## Definition & Classification

**Elevated Liver Enzymes**: Abnormal increases in serum markers of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis. Commonly includes ALT, AST (transaminases), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and bilirubin. Distinguish between patterns:

- Hepatocellular (ALT/AST predominant)
- Cholestatic (ALP/GGT ± bilirubin predominant)
- Mixed pattern

### Magnitude of Elevation (typical underwriting bands)

- Mild: <2× upper limit of normal (ULN)
- Moderate: 2–5× ULN
- Marked: >5× ULN

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Laboratory details**:
   - Specific enzymes elevated (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin) with values and reference ranges
   - Trends over time (at least 2–3 measurements)
   - Synthetic function: INR/PT, albumin, platelet count

2. **Clinical context**:
   - Symptoms (jaundice, pruritus, RUQ pain, fatigue) vs. asymptomatic
   - Alcohol intake, BMI, metabolic risk factors (T2DM, dyslipidemia), medications/supplements
   - Risk factors for viral hepatitis; vaccination status

3. **Evaluation performed**:
   - Viral hepatitis serologies (HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, HCV RNA if positive)
   - Autoimmune work-up (ANA, ASMA, AMA) if indicated
   - Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) for hemochromatosis
   - Imaging (ultrasound ± elastography) to assess steatosis/fibrosis/biliary obstruction
   - Consider ceruloplasmin (young), alpha-1 antitrypsin, celiac screen when indicated

4. **Diagnosis/attribution**:
   - Likely etiology (NAFLD/MASLD, alcohol-related, viral, drug-induced, autoimmune, cholestatic disease, obstruction)
   - Stage of liver disease if available (fibrosis score, elastography kPa)

5. **Treatment and response**:
   - Lifestyle changes (alcohol abstinence, weight loss)
   - Medication adjustments (stop offending drugs)
   - Antiviral or disease-specific therapy
   - Follow-up labs and trajectory

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Hepatology consultation
- Liver biopsy results
- Elastography trend or MRI if advanced disease suspected
- Documentation of portal hypertension or decompensation (ascites, varices, encephalopathy)

## Rating Guidelines

### Asymptomatic Mild Elevations (<2× ULN) with Benign Workup

| Pattern | Etiology | Trend | Rating |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Hepatocellular | Probable MASLD/NAFLD | Stable or improving | Standard to +25 points |
| Cholestatic | Post-cholecystectomy/benign | Stable | Standard to +25 points |
| Mixed | Medication-related, corrected | Normalizing | Standard |

### Moderate Elevations (2–5× ULN)

| Etiology/Findings | Status | Rating |
|-------------------|--------|--------|
| MASLD/NAFLD without fibrosis | Lifestyle therapy underway | +25 to +75 points |
| Alcohol-related suspected, abstinent ≥6 months | Enzymes improving | +25 to +75 points |
| Viral hepatitis negative; work-up pending | Awaiting results | Postpone |
| Autoimmune markers low titer, asymptomatic | Monitoring | +25 to +75 points |
| Medication-induced, drug discontinued | Improving | 0 to +50 points |

### Marked Elevations (>5× ULN) or Bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL

| Context | Status | Rating |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Acute hepatitis suspected | Work-up ongoing | Postpone |
| Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) | Offending agent stopped, recovery ongoing | Postpone or +100 to +150 points after recovery |
| Obstructive cholestasis (e.g., gallstone) | Resolved | 0 to +50 points based on residual labs |

### Evidence of Chronic Liver Disease or Impaired Synthetic Function

| Finding | Status | Rating |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Fibrosis stage F0–F1, normal INR/albumin, platelets normal | Stable | +25 to +75 points |
| Fibrosis stage F2–F3 without portal hypertension | Stable | +75 to +150 points |
| Cirrhosis (F4) compensated (Child-Pugh A) | Any | Individual consideration to Decline |
| Decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, variceal bleed, encephalopathy) | Any | Decline |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. New enzyme elevations without initial work-up
2. Suspected acute hepatitis (viral, ischemic, toxic) pending evaluation
3. DILI with ongoing elevation
4. Rising bilirubin or INR without diagnosis

### Decline

1. Decompensated cirrhosis or portal hypertension complications
2. Persistent marked elevations with unclear etiology and concerning imaging
3. Active alcohol use disorder with ongoing enzyme elevation

## Medication Considerations

| Category | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|
| Potential hepatotoxins | Acetaminophen (high dose), Amiodarone, Isoniazid, Methotrexate, Statins (rare) | Elevations may be drug-related; improvement after discontinuation favorable |
| Herbal/supplements | Kava, green tea extract (high dose), anabolic agents | Consider DILI; require cessation and recovery |
| Antivirals/DAAs | Sofosbuvir combinations | Favorable in treated HCV with normalization |

## Comorbidity Factors

| Comorbidity | Rating Adjustment |
|------------|-------------------|
| Obesity (BMI ≥30) | +25 to +50 points |
| Type 2 diabetes | +25 to +50 points |
| Hypertriglyceridemia | +25 points |
| Alcohol use (moderate-heavy) | +25 to +75 points |
| Hypertension/CVD | +25 points |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Objective improvement**:
   - Down-trending enzymes to <2× ULN or normalization
   - Weight loss ≥7–10% for MASLD/NAFLD
   - Sustained alcohol abstinence ≥6–12 months

2. **Favorable staging**:
   - Elastography indicating F0–F1
   - Normal synthetic function and platelets

3. **Etiology resolved**:
   - Successful antiviral therapy with sustained virologic response (SVR)
   - Post-obstruction resolution with normal labs

## Special Considerations

### Metabolic-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD/NAFLD)

- Look for metabolic syndrome features; modest ratings if no fibrosis, improving labs.

### Isolated GGT or ALP Elevation

- Evaluate for cholestatic disease, bone disease for ALP fractionation, and alcohol use; rate by etiology and trend.

### Isolated Mild Bilirubin Elevation

- Consider Gilbert syndrome if unconjugated and benign; usually Standard.
