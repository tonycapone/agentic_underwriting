# Hepatitis B and C

## Definition & Classification

**Viral Hepatitis**: Inflammation of the liver caused by specific viruses. This section covers Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), which can cause both acute and chronic infections with potentially serious liver complications.

### Hepatitis B (HBV)

**Phases of Chronic HBV Infection**:
- **HBeAg-positive chronic infection** (previously "immune tolerant"): High HBV DNA, normal ALT, minimal liver damage
- **HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis**: High HBV DNA, elevated ALT, moderate-severe liver damage
- **HBeAg-negative chronic infection** (previously "inactive carrier"): Low HBV DNA, normal ALT, minimal liver damage
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis**: Fluctuating HBV DNA, intermittently elevated ALT, progressive liver damage
- **HBsAg-negative phase** (resolved): Undetectable HBV DNA in serum, normal ALT, anti-HBc +/- anti-HBs positive

**Serological Markers**:
- **HBsAg**: Hepatitis B surface antigen - indicates current infection
- **Anti-HBs**: Antibody to HBsAg - indicates recovery or vaccination
- **HBeAg**: Hepatitis B e-antigen - indicates high viral replication
- **Anti-HBe**: Antibody to HBeAg - indicates lower viral replication
- **Anti-HBc**: Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen - indicates exposure to HBV

### Hepatitis C (HCV)

**Stages of HCV Infection**:
- **Acute HCV**: First 6 months of infection, often asymptomatic
- **Chronic HCV**: Persistence of HCV RNA for >6 months
- **Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)**: Undetectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after completing therapy
- **Relapse**: Recurrence of HCV RNA after initial clearance with treatment

**Genotypes**:
- Genotypes 1-7, with numerous subtypes
- Genotype 1 most common in US and Europe
- Previously affected treatment decisions; less relevant with modern direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)

### Fibrosis Assessment

**METAVIR Scoring System**:
- **F0**: No fibrosis
- **F1**: Mild fibrosis (portal fibrosis without septa)
- **F2**: Moderate fibrosis (portal fibrosis with few septa)
- **F3**: Advanced fibrosis (numerous septa without cirrhosis)
- **F4**: Cirrhosis

**Non-invasive Assessment**:
- **FibroScan** (Transient Elastography): Liver stiffness measurement in kPa
- **APRI Score**: AST to Platelet Ratio Index
- **FIB-4**: Fibrosis-4 Score (based on age, AST, ALT, and platelet count)
- **FibroTest**: Proprietary algorithm using serum biomarkers

## Required Evidence

## Laboratory Considerations

### Hepatitis B Monitoring

| Test | Normal Range | Underwriting Significance |
|------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **HBV DNA** | <20 IU/mL (undetectable) | Key marker of viral replication; trend more important than single value |
| **ALT/AST** | Varies by lab/gender | May fluctuate in chronic HBV; persistent elevation suggests active liver damage |
| **HBeAg** | Negative | Positive indicates high replication; conversion to negative suggests improved prognosis |
| **HBsAg Quantitative** | N/A | Decreasing levels may indicate higher chance of eventual HBsAg clearance |
| **Alpha-fetoprotein** | <10 ng/mL | Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma; upward trend concerning |

### Hepatitis C Assessment

| Test | Interpretation | Underwriting Significance |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **HCV RNA** | Undetectable | Essential for confirming SVR; must be negative at least 12 weeks post-treatment |
| **ALT/AST** | Normalizing post-SVR | Persistent elevation after SVR may indicate other liver disease |
| **APRI Score** | <0.7: minimal fibrosis<br>>1.5: significant fibrosis | Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis; decreasing trend favorable |
| **FIB-4** | <1.45: minimal fibrosis<br>>3.25: advanced fibrosis | Another non-invasive fibrosis score; more specific than APRI |
| **Liver Elastography** | <8 kPa: minimal fibrosis<br>>12.5 kPa: cirrhosis | Direct measurement of liver stiffness; more accurate than serum markers |

## Comorbidity Factors

The following conditions may increase viral hepatitis ratings:

| Comorbidity | Rating Adjustment |
|-------------|-------------------|
| HIV co-infection | +25 to +75 points |
| Excessive alcohol use | +50 to +100 points |
| Diabetes mellitus | +25 to +50 points |
| Metabolic syndrome | +25 to +50 points |
| Obesity (BMI >30) | +25 points |
| Hemochromatosis | +25 to +50 points |
| Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency | +25 points |
| Autoimmune hepatitis | +25 to +50 points |
| Immunosuppressive therapy | +25 to +50 points |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Viral control**:
   - For HCV: Achievement of SVR and longer duration post-SVR
   - For HBV: Sustained viral suppression with long-term therapy
   - HBsAg loss/seroconversion (HBV functional cure)

2. **Liver health improvement**:
   - Normalized liver enzymes
   - Improved fibrosis markers
   - Stable or improved liver stiffness on elastography
   - Regression of fibrosis on repeat biopsy

3. **Risk factor modification**:
   - Abstinence from alcohol
   - Weight reduction if overweight/obese
   - Control of diabetes/metabolic syndrome
   - Avoidance of hepatotoxic medications

4. **Ongoing monitoring**:
   - Regular hepatology follow-up
   - Consistent surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma if indicated
   - Viral load monitoring for HBV
   - Vaccination against HAV and HBV (if no HBV)

## Special Considerations

| Duration of Carrier State | Monitoring Status | Points |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------|
| <5 years | Regular monitoring | 0 to +25 points |
| 5-10 years | Regular monitoring, stable | 0 to +25 points |

**Modifying Factors**:
