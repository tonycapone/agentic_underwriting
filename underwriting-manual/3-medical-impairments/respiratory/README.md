# Respiratory Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting respiratory conditions, including:

## Common Respiratory Conditions

- [Asthma](asthma.md): Chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm.
- [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)](copd.md): Progressive lung disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
- [Sleep Apnea (OSA)](sleep_apnea.md): Sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep, with emphasis on obstructive sleep apnea.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Severity of condition**: Mild, moderate, or severe based on pulmonary function tests, symptoms, and treatment requirements
2. **Control of symptoms**: Frequency of exacerbations, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations
3. **Treatment compliance**: Adherence to prescribed medications and therapies
4. **Comorbid conditions**: Concurrent cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, or other conditions
5. **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking history, occupational exposures, and environmental factors
6. **Disease progression**: Stability versus deterioration of pulmonary function over time

## Evidence Requirements

- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
- Sleep studies (for sleep apnea)
- Chest X-rays or CT scans
- Specialist reports
- Hospital records for any exacerbations
- Current medication list
- Smoking history details

## General Approach

Respiratory conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, severity, control, and impact on overall mortality risk. Conditions range from standard rates for well-controlled mild disease to significant ratings or decline for severe, poorly controlled disease with complications.
