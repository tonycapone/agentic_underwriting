# Asthma

## Definition & Classification

**Asthma**: A chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and underlying inflammation. Asthma causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing.

### Classification Systems

**Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Classification by Symptom Control**:

| Component | Well Controlled | Partly Controlled | Uncontrolled |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Daytime symptoms | ≤2 times/week | >2 times/week | ≥3 features of partly controlled |
| Nocturnal symptoms | None | Any | |
| Reliever use | ≤2 times/week | >2 times/week | |
| Activity limitation | None | Any | |

**Asthma Severity Classification (Based on Treatment Required for Control)**:

| Severity | Treatment Required |
|----------|-------------------|
| Mild | Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or as-needed reliever |
| Moderate | Low-dose ICS/LABA or medium-dose ICS |
| Severe | Medium/high-dose ICS/LABA ± additional controllers |
| Very Severe | High-dose ICS/LABA + oral corticosteroids or biologics |

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Medical history** including:
   - Age at diagnosis
   - Frequency and severity of symptoms
   - Triggers and seasonal patterns
   - Nocturnal symptoms
   - Exercise tolerance

2. **Treatment information**:
   - Current medications and dosages
   - Frequency of rescue inhaler use
   - History of oral steroid use

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Recent hospitalization for asthma (<3 months)
2. Recent emergency department visit for asthma (<1 month)
3. Recent course of oral steroids (<1 month)
4. Recent significant change in treatment regimen (<3 months)
5. Pending pulmonary function tests or specialist evaluation

### Decline

1. History of respiratory failure requiring intubation within past 2 years
2. Multiple hospitalizations for asthma within past year
3. Continuous oral corticosteroid use with poor control
4. FEV1 <40% predicted despite optimal therapy
5. Non-compliance with essential asthma medications

## Medication Considerations

| Medication | Underwriting Significance |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Short-acting beta agonists (SABA) | Rescue medication; frequency of use indicates control level |
| Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) | Controller medication; low to medium dose indicates mild-moderate asthma |
| Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) | Always used with ICS; indicates at least moderate asthma |
| Leukotriene modifiers | Add-on therapy for mild-moderate asthma |
| Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) | Add-on therapy for moderate-severe asthma |
| Theophylline | Older therapy, may indicate more difficult control |
| Oral corticosteroids | Regular use indicates severe asthma |
| Biologics (anti-IgE, anti-IL5, etc.) | Indicates severe asthma |

## Comorbidity Factors

The following conditions may increase asthma ratings:

| Comorbidity | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Allergic rhinitis (controlled) | No adjustment |

   - No hospitalizations for >3 years

3. **Pulmonary function**:
   - Normal or near-normal spirometry
   - Minimal bronchodilator response
   - Normal peak flow with minimal variability

4. **Treatment optimization**:
   - Stable medication regimen
   - Step-down in therapy with maintained control
   - Good compliance with controller medications
   - Avoidance of known triggers
