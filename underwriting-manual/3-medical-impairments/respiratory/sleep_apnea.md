# Sleep Apnea (Obstructive Sleep Apnea - OSA)

Primary focus is OSA; CSA and other variants are addressed where relevant.

## Definition & Classification

**Sleep Apnea**: A sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep. Each pause can last for several seconds to a few minutes and may occur many times during sleep. The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where the airway is physically blocked; less common is central sleep apnea (CSA), where breathing stops due to lack of respiratory effort.

### Classification Systems

**Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)**:

| AHI (events/hour) | Severity |
|-------------------|----------|
| <5 | Normal |
| 5-14.9 | Mild |
| 15-29.9 | Moderate |
| ≥30 | Severe |

**Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI)**:
Includes apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs).

**Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI)**:
Number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by a certain percentage from baseline.

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic testing**:
   - Sleep study results (polysomnography or home sleep test)
   - AHI, RDI, and ODI values
   - Oxygen saturation nadir
   - Time spent with oxygen saturation <90%

2. **Medical history** including:
   - Duration of symptoms
   - Daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale if available)
   - History of motor vehicle accidents or near-misses due to sleepiness
   - Comorbid conditions

3. **Treatment information**:
   - Type of treatment (CPAP, BiPAP, oral appliance, surgery)
   - Duration of treatment
   - Compliance with therapy
   - Response to treatment
   - Download of CPAP/BiPAP usage data if available

4. **Follow-up information**:
   - Post-treatment sleep study results if available
   - Physician notes regarding symptom improvement
   - Weight changes since diagnosis

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Cardiovascular assessment
- Pulmonary function tests if coexisting lung disease
- ENT evaluation results
- Neurology consultation for central sleep apnea
