# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

## Definition & Classification

**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: A common, preventable, and treatable disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases.

### Classification Systems

**GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) Spirometric Classification**:

| GOLD Stage | Severity | FEV1 (% predicted) |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| GOLD 1 | Mild | ≥80% |
| GOLD 2 | Moderate | 50-79% |
| GOLD 3 | Severe | 30-49% |
| GOLD 4 | Very Severe | <30% |

**GOLD Combined Assessment (Symptoms and Exacerbation Risk)**:

| Group | Exacerbation History | Symptoms |
|-------|----------------------|----------|
| A | 0-1 per year, no hospitalization | Less symptoms (mMRC 0-1 or CAT <10) |
| B | 0-1 per year, no hospitalization | More symptoms (mMRC ≥2 or CAT ≥10) |
| C | ≥2 per year or ≥1 with hospitalization | Less symptoms (mMRC 0-1 or CAT <10) |
| D | ≥2 per year or ≥1 with hospitalization | More symptoms (mMRC ≥2 or CAT ≥10) |

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

   - Age at diagnosis
   - Smoking history (pack-years)
   - Occupational exposures
   - Frequency and severity of exacerbations
   - Hospitalizations for COPD
   - Current symptoms and limitations

2. **Pulmonary function tests**:
   - Spirometry results (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio)
   - Bronchodilator response
   - Diffusion capacity (DLCO) if available
   - Arterial blood gas results if available

3. **Treatment information**:
   - Current medications and dosages
   - Oxygen therapy requirements

- Sleep study results if sleep apnea suspected
- Echocardiogram if pulmonary hypertension suspected
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin level if early-onset or non-smoker
- Specialist consultation notes

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

2. Recent hospitalization for COPD (<6 months)
3. Recent significant change in treatment regimen (<3 months)
4. Pending pulmonary function tests or specialist evaluation
5. Recent initiation of oxygen therapy (<3 months)

## Medication Considerations

|------------|---------------------------|
| Short-acting bronchodilators only | Indicates milder disease |
