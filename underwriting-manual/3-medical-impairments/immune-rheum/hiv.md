# HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)

## Definition & Classification

**Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)**: A retrovirus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4+ T cells, weakening the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. If left untreated, HIV can progress to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

### Classification Systems

**CDC HIV Classification**:
- **Stage 0**: Early HIV infection (first 6 months after infection)
- **Stage 1**: HIV infection, CD4+ count ≥500 cells/mm³ or CD4+ percentage ≥29%
- **Stage 2**: HIV infection, CD4+ count 200-499 cells/mm³ or CD4+ percentage 14-28%
- **Stage 3**: HIV infection, CD4+ count <200 cells/mm³ or CD4+ percentage <14% or an AIDS-defining condition

**WHO Clinical Staging**:
- **Stage 1**: Asymptomatic or persistent generalized lymphadenopathy
- **Stage 2**: Moderate unexplained weight loss, recurrent respiratory infections, herpes zoster, etc.
- **Stage 3**: Severe weight loss, chronic diarrhea, pulmonary TB, severe bacterial infections, etc.
- **Stage 4**: AIDS-defining conditions including wasting syndrome, Pneumocystis pneumonia, extrapulmonary TB, etc.

**Treatment Response Categories**:
- **Optimal Response**: Undetectable viral load (<20-50 copies/mL), CD4+ recovery, asymptomatic
- **Suboptimal Response**: Detectable viral load, inadequate CD4+ recovery, minor complications
- **Poor Response**: Persistent viremia, declining CD4+ counts, opportunistic infections

## Required Evidence
