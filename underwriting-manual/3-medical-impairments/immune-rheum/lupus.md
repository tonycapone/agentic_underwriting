# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

## Definition & Classification

**Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: A chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, and blood vessels. SLE is characterized by periods of flares (active disease) alternating with periods of remission.

### Classification Systems

**2019 EULAR/ACR Classification Criteria**:
- Point-based system with cutoff of ≥10 points for SLE classification
- ANA ≥1:80 required as entry criterion
- Clinical and immunological domains weighted by importance
- Criteria include: constitutional symptoms, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, mucocutaneous, serosal, musculoskeletal, renal manifestations, and specific antibodies

**Lupus Subtypes**:
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)**: Multi-system involvement
- **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE)**: Primarily skin involvement
  - Acute cutaneous lupus (ACLE)
  - Subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE)
  - Chronic cutaneous lupus (CCLE), including discoid lupus
- **Drug-induced lupus**: Lupus-like symptoms triggered by medications
- **Neonatal lupus**: Transient condition in newborns born to mothers with specific antibodies

**Disease Activity Indexes**:
- **SLEDAI** (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index)
- **BILAG** (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group)
- **SLAM** (Systemic Lupus Activity Measure)
- **PGA** (Physician's Global Assessment)

**Damage Assessment**:
- **SLICC/ACR Damage Index**: Measures irreversible organ damage

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Category | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Antimalarials** | Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) | First-line therapy; favorable prognostic indicator if well-tolerated |
| **Corticosteroids** | Prednisone, Methylprednisolone | Dose and duration critical; higher doses/prolonged use concerning |
| **Conventional Immunosuppressants** | Azathioprine, Methotrexate, Leflunomide | Second-line therapy; moderate disease activity |
| **Mycophenolate Mofetil** | CellCept | Often used for lupus nephritis; indicates renal involvement |
| **Cyclophosphamide** | Cytoxan | Potent immunosuppressant for severe disease; indicates major organ involvement |
| **Biologics** | Belimumab (Benlysta), Rituximab | Newer targeted therapies; may indicate refractory disease or specific manifestations |
| **Tacrolimus/Cyclosporine** | Prograf, Neoral | Calcineurin inhibitors often used for renal or refractory disease |
| **NSAIDs** | Naproxen, Ibuprofen | Used for joint symptoms; generally favorable if only treatment needed |
