# Gout

## Definition & Classification

**Gout**: A crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate deposition due to hyperuricemia, presenting with acute flares (classically podagra) and potential progression to chronic gouty arthritis, tophi, and joint damage. Risk increases with age, male sex, obesity, CKD, diuretic use, high purine intake, alcohol (especially beer/spirits), and genetic factors.

### Classification Systems

- **ACR/EULAR Gout Classification Criteria (2015)**: Clinical pattern of joint involvement, time course, hyperuricemia, imaging (double contour sign on ultrasound; urate on DECT), and/or identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or tophus. Crystal confirmation is definitive when available.
- **Disease Phases**:
  - Asymptomatic hyperuricemia
  - Acute gout flare
  - Intercritical (between flares)
  - Chronic tophaceous gout

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Diagnosis by clinician and basis (clinical criteria vs. crystal confirmation)
   - Serum uric acid values (with dates) and trend
   - Sites and number of joints affected
   - Presence/absence of tophi (exam or imaging)

2. **Disease activity/history**:
   - Number of flares in past 12–24 months; severity and duration
   - Precipitants (diet, alcohol, dehydration, medication changes)
   - Intervals between flares; intercritical symptoms

3. **Treatment regimen**:
   - Acute therapy used (NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids)
   - Urate-lowering therapy (ULT): agent(s), start dates, doses, adherence
   - Flare prophylaxis during ULT initiation (colchicine/NSAID)
   - Target serum urate goal and attainment (<6.0 mg/dL; <5.0 mg/dL if tophi)

4. **Comorbidities and risks**:
   - CKD stage, nephrolithiasis history
   - Hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia
   - Alcohol intake; diuretic or low-dose aspirin use

5. **Investigations**:
   - Labs: serum urate, creatinine/eGFR, CBC if on colchicine, LFTs if on allopurinol/febuxostat
   - Imaging: ultrasound/DECT if performed; x-rays if chronic changes suspected

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Synovial fluid analysis confirming monosodium urate crystals
- Rheumatology consultation notes
- Documentation of tophus size/location and response to therapy
- Stone analysis confirming uric acid stones (if nephrolithiasis)
- Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients on febuxostat or with multiple comorbidities

## Rating Guidelines

### Uncomplicated Gout (No tophi, ≤2 flares/year, urate goal achieved)

| Control/Status | ULT Status | Rating |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Serum urate <6 mg/dL, no flares ≥12 months | On stable ULT ≥6 months | Standard to Table 1 |
| Serum urate <6 mg/dL, ≤1 mild flare in past year | On ULT | Table 1–2 |
| Serum urate 6–7 mg/dL, ≤2 flares/year | On or initiating ULT | Table 2–3 |

**Modifying Factors**:
- Age <40 at onset: +1 table
- BMI ≥30 or metabolic syndrome: +1 table
- CKD stage 3: +1 table; stage 4–5: +2–3 tables
- Strong adherence with ≥12 months at goal urate and flare-free: -1 table
- No diuretic use and limited alcohol: -1 table

### Recurrent/Chronic Gout (≥3 flares/year, tophi, or chronic arthropathy)

| Findings | Status | Rating |
|---------|--------|--------|
| ≥3 flares/year, not at urate goal | Any therapy | Table 3–5 |
| Tophi present, improving on therapy | ULT ≥6 months, urate <6 mg/dL | Table 3–4 |
| Tophi present, persistent/not improving | Any | Table 5–7 |
| Chronic gouty arthropathy (imaging changes) | Functional impact minimal | Table 4–6 |
| Chronic gouty arthropathy with functional limitation | Work/ADL impacted | Table 6–8 |

### Gout with Renal or Stone Disease

| Condition | Details | Rating |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Uric acid nephrolithiasis | Single remote episode, no recurrence | Table 2–3 |
| Recurrent uric acid stones | ≥2 episodes in 5 years | Table 4–6 |
| CKD stage 4–5 or urate nephropathy | Any | Individual consideration to Decline |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Acute flare within the past 4 weeks until resolved and baseline function restored
2. ULT initiation or dose escalation within the past 8 weeks with active flare risk
3. Recent hospitalization for gout complication (<3 months)
4. Uncontrolled serum urate (≥8 mg/dL) with frequent flares—defer until treatment stabilized

### Decline

1. Severe functional impairment preventing activities of daily living due to chronic gout
2. Ongoing nonadherence with repeated hospitalizations for flares
3. Advanced CKD on dialysis with refractory gout complications
4. Chronic infection of tophaceous ulcers with osteomyelitis

## Medication Considerations

| Medication/Class | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| NSAIDs | Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Indomethacin | First-line for flares; neutral unless chronic high-dose use |
| Colchicine | Standard dosing or prophylaxis | Signals active flare management; monitor for toxicity in CKD |
| Corticosteroids | Prednisone oral or intra-articular | Short-term for flares; frequent courses suggest poor control |
| Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors | Allopurinol, Febuxostat | Foundation ULT; attainment of goal urate favorable |
| Uricosurics | Probenecid (if eGFR adequate) | Indicates alternative strategy; avoid with uric acid stones |
| Biologic/Advanced | Pegloticase | Indicates refractory severe gout; higher rating tables |
| Contributing meds | Thiazide/loop diuretics, low-dose aspirin | May worsen hyperuricemia; consider mitigation |

## Comorbidity Factors

| Comorbidity | Rating Adjustment |
|------------|-------------------|
| Obesity (BMI ≥30) | +1 table |
| Type 2 diabetes | +1–2 tables |
| Hypertension (uncontrolled) | +1 table |
| CKD stage 3 | +1 table |
| CKD stage 4–5 | +2–3 tables |
| Coronary artery disease | +1–3 tables |
| Alcohol use (heavy) | +1 table |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Serum urate control**:
   - Sustained urate <6 mg/dL for ≥12 months (<5 mg/dL if tophi)
   - No flares for ≥12 months
   - Demonstrated adherence to ULT and prophylaxis

2. **Risk factor modification**:
   - Weight reduction if overweight/obese
   - Reduced alcohol intake, especially beer/spirits
   - Review and adjustment of hyperuricemia-inducing medications when possible

3. **Disease control evidence**:
   - Resolution/shrinkage of tophi
   - Improved function and fewer or no steroid bursts
   - Stable or improved renal function

## Special Considerations

### Gout with Cardiometabolic Syndrome

- Concomitant hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance are common; integrate global CV risk into rating and management expectations.
- Aggressive lifestyle modification and BP/lipid control can justify lower tables when disease control is documented.

### Gout in Women and Elderly

- Often associated with diuretic use and CKD; evaluate secondary contributors and potential for improvement with medication changes and ULT.

### Asymptomatic Hyperuricemia

- Not gout; no rating solely for elevated urate. Consider only if associated with CKD or stones.
