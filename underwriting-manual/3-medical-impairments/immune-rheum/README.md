# Immune & Rheumatologic Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting immune and rheumatologic conditions, including:

## Common Immune & Rheumatologic Conditions

- [HIV](hiv.md): Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and its impact on the immune system.
- [Lupus](lupus.md): Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease affecting multiple organ systems.
- [Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)](ra.md): Chronic inflammatory disorder affecting joints and potentially other body systems.
- [Gout](gout.md): Crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis due to hyperuricemia; acute flares and chronic tophaceous disease.
- [Post-Transplant](post_transplant.md): Evaluation of risk following organ transplantation and associated immunosuppression.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and classification**: Specific condition, diagnostic criteria, and classification criteria
2. **Disease activity**: Active, remission, or flare pattern; disease activity scores when available
3. **Disease duration**: Time since diagnosis and pattern of progression
4. **Organ system involvement**: Extent and severity of organ involvement
5. **Treatment regimen**: Medications, biologics, immunosuppressants, and response to treatment
6. **Complications**: Disease-specific complications, treatment-related complications
7. **Comorbidities**: Associated conditions that may affect prognosis
8. **Functional status**: Impact on daily activities and disability level

## Evidence Requirements

- Specialist consultation reports (rheumatology, immunology, infectious disease)
- Laboratory test results (inflammatory markers, autoantibodies, CD4 counts, viral loads)
- Imaging studies (joint imaging, organ-specific imaging)
- Treatment history and current medication regimen
- Hospitalization history related to immune/rheumatologic conditions
- Functional assessments (for rheumatologic conditions)
- Transplant records and post-transplant monitoring (if applicable)
- Evidence of regular follow-up and monitoring

## General Approach

Immune and rheumatologic conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, disease activity, organ involvement, treatment effectiveness, and functional impact. Ratings range from standard to mild ratings for well-controlled conditions with minimal organ involvement and good functional status to significant ratings or decline for poorly controlled disease with major organ involvement, complications, or functional limitations. HIV is evaluated based on current treatment standards, with well-controlled disease on effective antiretroviral therapy potentially qualifying for standard to mild ratings.
