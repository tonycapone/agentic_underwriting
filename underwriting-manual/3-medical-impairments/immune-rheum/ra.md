# Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

## Definition & Classification

**Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**: A chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease primarily affecting synovial joints, characterized by persistent symmetric polyarthritis, joint erosion, potential extra-articular manifestations, and serological abnormalities including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA/anti-CCP).

### Classification Systems

**2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria**:
- Point system based on:
  1. Joint involvement (number and size)
  2. Serology (RF and anti-CCP)
  3. Acute-phase reactants (ESR and CRP)
  4. Duration of symptoms
- Score ≥6/10 indicates definite RA

**Disease Duration Categories**:
- **Early RA**: Symptoms <6 months to 2 years (definitions vary)
- **Established RA**: Symptoms >2 years
- **Long-standing RA**: Typically >10 years of disease

**Disease Activity Assessment**:
- **Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)**
- **Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)**
- **Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)**
- **Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3)**

**Functional Classification**:
- **ACR Functional Class I**: Complete function without limitations
- **ACR Functional Class II**: Adequate for normal activities with discomfort/limited mobility
- **ACR Functional Class III**: Restricted function, limited activities of daily living
- **ACR Functional Class IV**: Incapacitated, confined to bed/wheelchair

### Serologic Status

- **Seropositive RA**: Presence of RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies
- **Seronegative RA**: Absence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies

### Extra-articular Manifestations

- **Rheumatoid nodules**
- **Pulmonary involvement** (interstitial lung disease, pleuritis)
- **Cardiovascular disease** (pericarditis, accelerated atherosclerosis)
- **Ocular disease** (scleritis, episcleritis, sicca syndrome)
- **Neurological involvement** (compression neuropathies, mononeuritis multiplex)
- **Felty's syndrome** (RA, splenomegaly, neutropenia)
- **Rheumatoid vasculitis**
