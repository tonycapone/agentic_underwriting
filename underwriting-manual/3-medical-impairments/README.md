## Using This Section

Each medical condition is presented in a standardized format:

1. **Definition & Classification**: Medical definition and relevant classification systems
2. **Required Evidence**: Minimum documentation needed for assessment
3. **Rating Guidelines**: Tables showing ratings by severity/control
4. **Postpone/Decline Criteria**: Conditions requiring postponement or decline
5. **Medication Considerations**: Common treatments and their underwriting implications
6. **Comorbidity Factors**: How other conditions affect the rating
7. **Improvement Factors**: Criteria for improved ratings over time
8. **References**: Medical sources supporting the guidelines

## General Principles for Medical Underwriting

1. **Recency of Information**: Medical evidence should generally be within 12 months
2. **Treatment Compliance**: Demonstrated compliance improves ratings
3. **Stability**: Stable conditions receive more favorable consideration
4. **Follow-up Care**: Regular physician monitoring is expected for chronic conditions
5. **Multiple Impairments**: Combined ratings may be greater than the sum of individual ratings

## Special Considerations

1. **Age Considerations**: Some conditions have different mortality implications at different ages
2. **Gender Differences**: Where medically relevant, separate guidelines may exist
3. **Family History Impact**: May modify ratings for certain genetic conditions
4. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Positive changes may improve ratings over time
