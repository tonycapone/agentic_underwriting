# Prostate Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Prostate Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the prostate gland. It is one of the most common cancers in men, particularly in those over 50 years of age. Prostate cancer typically grows slowly and initially remains confined to the prostate gland.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Adenocarcinoma**: Most common type (>95% of cases)
- **Small cell carcinoma**: Rare, aggressive variant
- **Neuroendocrine tumors**: Rare, often aggressive
- **Transitional cell carcinoma**: Rare, arising from the prostatic urethra
- **Sarcomas**: Very rare mesenchymal tumors

**TNM Staging System**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - T1: Clinically inapparent tumor (not palpable or visible by imaging)
    - T1a: Incidental finding in ≤5% of tissue resected
    - T1b: Incidental finding in >5% of tissue resected
    - T1c: Identified by needle biopsy (due to elevated PSA)
  - T2: Tumor confined to prostate
    - T2a: Involves ≤half of one lobe
    - T2b: Involves >half of one lobe but not both lobes
    - T2c: Involves both lobes
  - T3: Tumor extends through the prostatic capsule
    - T3a: Extracapsular extension
    - T3b: Invades seminal vesicle(s)
  - T4: Tumor is fixed or invades adjacent structures

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Regional lymph node metastasis

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis
    - M1a: Non-regional lymph node(s)
    - M1b: Bone(s)
    - M1c: Other site(s)

**Stage Grouping**:
- **Stage I**: T1-T2a, N0, M0, Gleason ≤6, PSA <10
- **Stage IIA**: T1-T2a, N0, M0, Gleason 7, PSA <20 or T2b-T2c, N0, M0, Gleason ≤7, PSA <20
- **Stage IIB**: T1-T2, N0, M0, Gleason ≥8 or PSA ≥20
- **Stage III**: T3-T4, N0, M0, Any Gleason, Any PSA
- **Stage IV**: Any T, N1, M0, Any Gleason, Any PSA or Any T, Any N, M1, Any Gleason, Any PSA

**Gleason Score/Grade Group**:
- **Grade Group 1**: Gleason score ≤6
- **Grade Group 2**: Gleason score 3+4=7
- **Grade Group 3**: Gleason score 4+3=7
- **Grade Group 4**: Gleason score 8
- **Grade Group 5**: Gleason score 9-10

**Risk Stratification**:
- **Very Low Risk**: T1c, Grade Group 1, PSA <10 ng/mL, fewer than 3 positive biopsy cores, ≤50% cancer in any core, PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/g
- **Low Risk**: T1-T2a, Grade Group 1, PSA <10 ng/mL
- **Intermediate Risk**: T2b-T2c or Grade Group 2-3 or PSA 10-20 ng/mL
- **High Risk**: T3a or Grade Group 4-5 or PSA >20 ng/mL
- **Very High Risk**: T3b-T4 or Primary Gleason pattern 5 or >4 cores with Grade Group 4-5
