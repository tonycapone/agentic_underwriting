# Lymphoma

## Definition & Classification

**Lymphoma**: A group of blood cancers that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), affecting the lymphatic system including lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and other organs. Lymphomas are broadly categorized into Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

### Major Types of Lymphoma

**Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)**:
- **Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma** (CHL):
  - Nodular sclerosis HL (most common)
  - Mixed cellularity HL
  - Lymphocyte-rich HL
  - Lymphocyte-depleted HL
- **Nodular Lymphocyte-Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma** (NLPHL)

**Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)**:
- **B-cell Lymphomas** (85% of NHL):
  - **Indolent B-cell Lymphomas**:
    - Follicular lymphoma (FL)
    - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)
    - Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)
    - Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia
    - Hairy cell leukemia
  - **Aggressive B-cell Lymphomas**:
    - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
    - Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
    - Burkitt lymphoma
    - High-grade B-cell lymphoma
    - Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma
- **T-cell Lymphomas** (15% of NHL):
  - Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL)
  - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
  - Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
  - Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma
  - Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)
- **Extranodal Lymphomas**:
  - Primary CNS lymphoma
  - Gastric MALT lymphoma
  - Primary cutaneous lymphomas (mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome)

### Staging Systems

**Ann Arbor Staging System** (with Cotswold modifications):
- **Stage I**: Single lymph node region or extralymphatic site (IE)
- **Stage II**: Two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm, or localized involvement of an extralymphatic site (IIE)
- **Stage III**: Lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm
- **Stage IV**: Disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs

**Modifiers**:
- **A**: No B symptoms
- **B**: Presence of B symptoms (fever >38°C, night sweats, weight loss >10% body weight over 6 months)
- **X**: Bulky disease (>10cm mass or mediastinal mass >1/3 chest diameter)
- **E**: Extranodal involvement

**Additional Classification Systems**:
- **Lugano Classification**: Updated Ann Arbor system
- **Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI)**
- **Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI)**
- **International Prognostic Index (IPI)** for aggressive NHL
- **Hasenclever Index** for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma
