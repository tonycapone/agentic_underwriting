# Thyroid Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Thyroid Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland located in the lower front of the neck. Thyroid cancer is one of the most curable cancers, with excellent survival rates for most types when diagnosed early.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (DTC)**: 
  - **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC)**: Most common type (80-85% of cases)
    - Classical variant
    - Follicular variant
    - Tall cell variant
    - Columnar cell variant
    - Diffuse sclerosing variant
    - Solid/trabecular variant
    - Oncocytic variant
  - **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (FTC)**: Second most common (10-15% of cases)
    - Minimally invasive
    - Widely invasive
    - Hürthle cell (oncocytic) carcinoma
- **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC)**: Arises from C cells (5% of cases)
  - Sporadic (75% of MTC cases)
  - Hereditary (25% of MTC cases, associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, FMTC)
- **Poorly Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma**: Aggressive behavior, intermediate between differentiated and anaplastic
- **Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC)**: Rare, highly aggressive (<2% of cases)

**TNM Staging System** (AJCC 8th Edition - Age considerations incorporated):
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumor
  - T1: Tumor ≤2 cm, limited to the thyroid
    - T1a: Tumor ≤1 cm
    - T1b: Tumor >1 cm but ≤2 cm
  - T2: Tumor >2 cm but ≤4 cm, limited to the thyroid
  - T3: Tumor >4 cm limited to the thyroid, or gross extrathyroidal extension invading only strap muscles
    - T3a: Tumor >4 cm, limited to the thyroid
    - T3b: Gross extrathyroidal extension invading only strap muscles from a tumor of any size
  - T4: Includes gross extrathyroidal extension beyond strap muscles
    - T4a: Gross extrathyroidal extension invading subcutaneous soft tissues, larynx, trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve
    - T4b: Gross extrathyroidal extension invading prevertebral fascia, carotid artery, or mediastinal vessels

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
  - N0: No evidence of regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Regional lymph node metastasis
    - N1a: Metastasis to level VI or VII lymph nodes (pretracheal, paratracheal, prelaryngeal/Delphian, or upper mediastinal)
    - N1b: Metastasis to unilateral, bilateral, or contralateral lateral neck lymph nodes (levels I, II, III, IV, or V) or retropharyngeal lymph nodes

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis

**Prognostic Staging Groups** (for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer):
- **Patients <55 years old**:
  - **Stage I**: Any T, Any N, M0
  - **Stage II**: Any T, Any N, M1
- **Patients ≥55 years old**:
  - **Stage I**: T1-T2, N0/NX, M0
  - **Stage II**: T1-T2, N1, M0 or T3a/T3b, Any N, M0
  - **Stage III**: T4a, Any N, M0
  - **Stage IV**: T4b, Any N, M0 or Any T, Any N, M1

**Risk Stratification Systems**:
- **American Thyroid Association (ATA) Risk of Recurrence**:
  - **Low Risk**: Intrathyroidal DTC, ≤5 nodal micrometastases
  - **Intermediate Risk**: Aggressive histology, minor extrathyroidal extension, vascular invasion, >5 nodal metastases (0.2-3 cm)
  - **High Risk**: Gross extrathyroidal extension, incomplete tumor resection, distant metastases, or lymph node metastasis ≥3 cm
