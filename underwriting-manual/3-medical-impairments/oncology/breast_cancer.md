# Breast Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Breast Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the breast. It is the most common cancer in women worldwide, though it can also occur in men. Breast cancer typically originates in the milk ducts (ductal carcinoma) or the milk-producing glands (lobular carcinoma).

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)**: Non-invasive cancer confined to the milk ducts
- **Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS)**: Non-invasive cancer confined to the milk-producing lobules
- **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)**: Cancer that has spread beyond the ducts into surrounding breast tissue
- **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**: Cancer that has spread beyond the lobules into surrounding breast tissue
- **Other subtypes**: Medullary, mucinous, tubular, inflammatory, Paget's disease, etc.

**TNM Staging System**:
- **T (Tumor Size)**:
  - Tis: Carcinoma in situ
  - T1: ≤2 cm
  - T2: >2 cm but ≤5 cm
  - T3: >5 cm
  - T4: Any size with direct extension to chest wall or skin

- **N (Lymph Node Involvement)**:
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis to movable ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s)
  - N2: Metastasis to fixed ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s)
  - N3: Metastasis to ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s)

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis present

**Stage Grouping**:
- **Stage 0**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T0-2, N1, M0 or T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T0-4, N2-3, M0 or T3-4, N0-2, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, Any N, M1

**Molecular Subtypes**:
- **Hormone Receptor Positive (ER+/PR+)**: Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive
- **HER2 Positive**: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression
- **Triple Negative**: Negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2
- **Triple Positive**: Positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2

**Histological Grade (Nottingham/Bloom-Richardson)**:
- **Grade 1**: Well-differentiated (slow-growing, less aggressive)
- **Grade 2**: Moderately differentiated
- **Grade 3**: Poorly differentiated (faster-growing, more aggressive)
