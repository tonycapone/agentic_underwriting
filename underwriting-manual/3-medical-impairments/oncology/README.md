## General Oncology Assessment Principles

When evaluating cancer risk, consider:

1. **Tumor Characteristics**: Histology, grade, size, stage
2. **Treatment Status**: Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy
3. **Time Since Diagnosis**: Recurrence risk highest in early years
4. **Response to Treatment**: Complete vs. partial response
5. **Surveillance Adherence**: Regular follow-up and monitoring
6. **Prognostic Factors**: Molecular markers, genetic testing
7. **Comorbidities**: Other conditions that may compound cancer risk

## Key Diagnostic and Surveillance Tests

| Test | Significance | Application |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Imaging (CT, MRI, PET) | Detects primary and metastatic disease | Initial staging, surveillance |
| Tumor Markers | Disease activity, recurrence monitoring | Trending values over time |
| Genetic/Molecular Testing | Risk stratification, treatment selection | Hereditary risk, precision medicine |
| Endoscopy/Colonoscopy | Direct visualization of lesions | GI cancers, surveillance |
| Biopsy/Pathology | Definitive diagnosis, grading | Gold standard for diagnosis |
| Liquid Biopsy/ctDNA | Non-invasive monitoring | Emerging technology for recurrence detection |

## Cancer Treatment Modalities

| Treatment | Description | Underwriting Considerations |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Surgery | Resection of tumor | Completeness of resection, margins |
| Radiation | Targeted radiation to destroy cancer cells | Field, dose, side effects |
| Chemotherapy | Systemic therapy targeting rapidly dividing cells | Regimen, duration, response |
| Hormone Therapy | Blocks hormones that fuel cancer growth | Duration, compliance, side effects |
| Targeted Therapy | Drugs targeting specific molecular features | Specific mutations, resistance patterns |
| Immunotherapy | Enhances immune system to fight cancer | Response durability, side effects |
| Stem Cell Transplant | Replenishes bone marrow after high-dose therapy | Type, complications, engraftment |

## Common Terminology in Cancer Reports

| Term | Definition | Underwriting Significance |
|------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Complete Response (CR) | Disappearance of all target lesions | Best prognosis |
| Partial Response (PR) | ≥30% decrease in target lesions | Good but incomplete response |
| Stable Disease (SD) | Neither PR nor PD | Disease control but not optimal |
| Progressive Disease (PD) | ≥20% increase in target lesions | Poor prognosis |
| Recurrence/Relapse | Return of cancer after period of remission | Significantly increases risk |
| Adjuvant Therapy | Treatment after primary therapy to prevent recurrence | Standard approach for many cancers |
| Neoadjuvant Therapy | Treatment before primary therapy | Often for larger tumors |
| Metastasis | Spread of cancer to distant sites | Significantly increases risk |
| Margins | Edge of resected specimen | Positive margins increase recurrence risk |
| Microsatellite Instability | DNA repair deficiency marker | Better prognosis with immunotherapy |
| Tumor Mutational Burden | Measure of mutations in tumor | Predicts immunotherapy response |

## Cancer Staging Systems

Most cancers follow the TNM system:
- **T**: Primary Tumor size/extent
- **N**: Regional lymph Node involvement
- **M**: Distant Metastasis

These components combine to create stage groupings (typically I-IV), with higher stages indicating more advanced disease and generally poorer prognosis.

## Special Considerations

1. **Childhood Cancer Survivors**: Consider long-term treatment effects
2. **Older Applicants**: Age-adjusted expectations for some parameters
3. **Multiple Primary Cancers**: Each requires separate evaluation
4. **Hereditary Cancer Syndromes**: Higher risk of additional cancers
5. **Clinical Trial Participation**: Emerging therapies with limited data
6. **Minimal Residual Disease**: Sensitive detection of remaining cancer cells
