# Kidney (Renal) Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Kidney Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the kidney. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for approximately 90% of kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is about twice as common in men as in women and typically occurs in people over 40 years of age.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**:
  - Clear Cell RCC: Most common subtype (70-75% of RCCs)
  - Papillary RCC: Second most common (10-15% of RCCs)
    - Type 1: Better prognosis
    - Type 2: More aggressive
  - Chromophobe RCC: Generally favorable prognosis (5% of RCCs)
  - Collecting Duct Carcinoma: Rare, aggressive variant (<1% of RCCs)
  - Renal Medullary Carcinoma: Rare, very aggressive, associated with sickle cell trait
  - Unclassified RCC: Rare, heterogeneous group
- **Transitional Cell Carcinoma**: Arises from the renal pelvis (5-10% of kidney cancers)
- **Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)**: Most common in children
- **Renal Sarcoma**: Rare mesenchymal tumors of the kidney

**TNM Staging System**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumor
  - T1: Tumor ≤7 cm, limited to the kidney
    - T1a: Tumor ≤4 cm
    - T1b: Tumor >4 cm but ≤7 cm
  - T2: Tumor >7 cm, limited to the kidney
    - T2a: Tumor >7 cm but ≤10 cm
    - T2b: Tumor >10 cm
  - T3: Tumor extends into major veins or perinephric tissues but not beyond Gerota's fascia
    - T3a: Tumor extends into renal vein or its segmental branches, or invades perirenal fat
    - T3b: Tumor extends into vena cava below the diaphragm
    - T3c: Tumor extends into vena cava above the diaphragm or invades the wall of the vena cava
  - T4: Tumor invades beyond Gerota's fascia (including direct extension into ipsilateral adrenal gland)

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis in regional lymph node(s)

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis present

**Stage Grouping**:
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N0, M0 or T1-3, N1, M0
- **Stage IV**: T4, Any N, M0 or Any T, Any N, M1

**Fuhrman Nuclear Grade (Clear Cell and Papillary RCC)**:
- **Grade 1**: Nuclei small (~10μm), round, uniform; nucleoli inconspicuous
- **Grade 2**: Nuclei slightly larger (~15μm), irregular; nucleoli visible at high power
- **Grade 3**: Nuclei larger (~20μm), very irregular; nucleoli prominent
- **Grade 4**: Nuclei bizarre, multilobed; nucleoli prominent; chromatin clumped

**WHO/ISUP Grade (Replacing Fuhrman)**:
- **Grade 1**: Nucleoli absent or inconspicuous at 400x magnification
- **Grade 2**: Nucleoli conspicuous at 400x but not at 100x magnification
- **Grade 3**: Nucleoli conspicuous at 100x magnification
- **Grade 4**: Extreme nuclear pleomorphism, sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation
