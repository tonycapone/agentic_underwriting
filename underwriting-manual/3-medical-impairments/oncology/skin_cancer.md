# Skin Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Skin Cancer**: A malignant growth of skin cells, primarily caused by ultraviolet radiation exposure, genetic factors, or a combination of both. It is the most common type of cancer worldwide.

### Major Types of Skin Cancer

**Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC)**:
- **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: The most common type of skin cancer, arising from the basal cells in the epidermis; typically slow-growing and rarely metastasizes
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: The second most common type of skin cancer, arising from squamous cells in the epidermis; more aggressive than BCC with potential for metastasis
- **Other NMSC Types**: Merkel cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, etc.

**Melanoma**:
- Arises from melanocytes (pigment-producing cells)
- More aggressive with higher metastatic potential
- Classifications:
  - **Superficial spreading melanoma**: Most common type
  - **Nodular melanoma**: Aggressive variant, grows vertically
  - **Lentigo maligna melanoma**: Often on sun-damaged skin of older individuals
  - **Acral lentiginous melanoma**: On palms, soles, or under nails
  - **Amelanotic melanoma**: Lacks pigmentation, often diagnosed late

### Staging Systems

**Basal Cell and Squamous Cell Carcinoma Staging (AJCC 8th Edition)**:
- Primary tumor (T) based on size, invasion, and high-risk features
- Nodal status (N) based on lymph node involvement
- Metastasis (M) based on presence of distant metastasis
- Simplified staging: Local, Regional, or Distant disease

**Melanoma Staging (AJCC 8th Edition)**:
- **Stage 0**: Melanoma in situ
- **Stage I**: ≤2.0 mm without ulceration (IA) or ≤1.0 mm with ulceration or >1.0-2.0 mm without ulceration (IB)
- **Stage II**: >2.0 mm without ulceration (IIA), 2.1-4.0 mm with ulceration or >4.0 mm without ulceration (IIB), or >4.0 mm with ulceration (IIC)
- **Stage III**: Regional node or in-transit metastases (various subcategories)
- **Stage IV**: Distant metastases

**Breslow Thickness** (for Melanoma):
- **≤1.0 mm**: Thin melanoma
- **1.01-2.0 mm**: Intermediate thickness
- **2.01-4.0 mm**: Thick melanoma
- **>4.0 mm**: Very thick melanoma

**Clark's Level** (for Melanoma - historical but still reported):
- **Level I**: Confined to the epidermis (in situ)
- **Level II**: Invasion into the papillary dermis
- **Level III**: Invasion to the junction of papillary and reticular dermis
- **Level IV**: Invasion into the reticular dermis
- **Level V**: Invasion into the subcutaneous fat
