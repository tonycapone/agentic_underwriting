# Ovarian Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Ovarian Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the ovary or, in some cases, the fallopian tube or peritoneum. Ovarian cancer is characterized by its intraperitoneal pattern of spread, high recurrence rates, and often presents at advanced stages due to vague symptoms and lack of effective screening methods. It is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in developed countries.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Epithelial Ovarian Cancer** (approximately 90% of cases):
  - **High-grade serous carcinoma** (HGSC): Most common subtype (70% of all epithelial ovarian cancers); aggressive, often BRCA-associated, typically diagnosed at advanced stages
  - **Low-grade serous carcinoma** (LGSC): Less common, often presents in younger women, more indolent course
  - **Endometrioid carcinoma**: Often associated with endometriosis, better prognosis than serous
  - **Clear cell carcinoma**: Associated with endometriosis, more chemoresistant
  - **Mucinous carcinoma**: Rare, often unilateral and early stage when primary
  - **Carcinosarcoma**: Aggressive, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal components

- **Non-epithelial Ovarian Cancer**:
  - **Sex cord-stromal tumors** (approximately 7%):
    - Granulosa cell tumors (adult and juvenile types)
    - Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors
    - Steroid cell tumors
  - **Germ cell tumors** (approximately 3%):
    - Dysgerminoma
    - Yolk sac tumor
    - Embryonal carcinoma
    - Immature teratoma
    - Mixed germ cell tumors
    - Choriocarcinoma

- **Borderline Ovarian Tumors** (Low Malignant Potential):
  - Serous borderline tumors
  - Mucinous borderline tumors
  - Others (seromucinous, clear cell, endometrioid)

- **Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma**: Histologically similar to epithelial ovarian cancer but arises from the peritoneum

- **Fallopian Tube Carcinoma**: Now understood to be the site of origin for many high-grade serous ovarian cancers

**WHO Classification** (2020):
- Serous tumors
- Mucinous tumors
- Endometrioid tumors
- Clear cell tumors
- Brenner tumors
- Seromucinous tumors
- Undifferentiated carcinoma
- Mixed epithelial tumors
