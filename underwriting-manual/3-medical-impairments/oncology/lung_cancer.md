# Lung Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Lung Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the lung, primarily in the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is strongly associated with tobacco smoking.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**: Approximately 85% of lung cancers
  - Adenocarcinoma: Most common type, often in outer lung areas
  - Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Often in central lung, near major bronchi
  - Large Cell Carcinoma: Can appear in any part of the lung, tends to grow and spread quickly
- **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)**: Approximately 15% of lung cancers, highly aggressive
- **Other types**: Carcinoid tumors, adenoid cystic carcinomas, lymphomas, sarcomas

**TNM Staging System for NSCLC**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - Tx: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumor
  - Tis: Carcinoma in situ
  - T1: ≤3 cm, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, not in main bronchus
  - T2: >3 cm but ≤5 cm, or involving main bronchus but not carina, or invading visceral pleura, or associated with atelectasis/obstructive pneumonitis
  - T3: >5 cm but ≤7 cm, or directly invading chest wall, pericardium, phrenic nerve, or separate tumor nodule(s) in same lobe
  - T4: >7 cm or invading mediastinum, diaphragm, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, spine, or carina; or separate tumor nodule(s) in different ipsilateral lobe

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar lymph nodes
  - N2: Metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes
  - N3: Metastasis in contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1a: Separate tumor nodule(s) in a contralateral lobe; pleural or pericardial nodules or malignant pleural or pericardial effusion
  - M1b: Single extrathoracic metastasis
  - M1c: Multiple extrathoracic metastases in one or more organs

**Stage Grouping for NSCLC**:
- **Stage 0**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage IA1**: T1a(mi) or T1a, N0, M0
- **Stage IA2**: T1b, N0, M0
- **Stage IA3**: T1c, N0, M0
- **Stage IB**: T2a, N0, M0
- **Stage IIA**: T2b, N0, M0
- **Stage IIB**: T1-2, N1, M0 or T3, N0, M0
- **Stage IIIA**: T1-2, N2, M0 or T3-4, N1, M0
- **Stage IIIB**: T1-2, N3, M0 or T3-4, N2, M0
- **Stage IIIC**: T3-4, N3, M0
- **Stage IVA**: Any T, Any N, M1a or M1b
- **Stage IVB**: Any T, Any N, M1c

**Small Cell Lung Cancer Staging**:
- **Limited Stage**: Confined to one hemithorax, regional lymph nodes, and/or ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes
- **Extensive Stage**: Disease beyond limited stage boundaries

## Medication Considerations

| **Immunotherapy** | Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Nivolumab (Opdivo) | May indicate advanced disease; response can be durable in some cases |
| **Chemotherapy** | Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Pemetrexed, Etoposide | Standard treatment; type and duration indicate disease severity and stage |
| **Angiogenesis Inhibitors** | Bevacizumab (Avastin) | Often used in combination with chemotherapy for advanced disease |
| **ROS1 Inhibitors** | Crizotinib (Xalkori), Entrectinib (Rozlytrek) | Indicates ROS1 rearrangement; may have better prognosis |
| **BRAF Inhibitors** | Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) + Trametinib (Mekinist) | Indicates BRAF mutation; less common in lung cancer |
| **Supportive Medications** | Pain medications, anti-emetics | Assess based on symptoms being treated |
