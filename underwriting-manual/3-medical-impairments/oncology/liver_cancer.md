# Liver Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Liver Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm originating in the liver, most commonly presenting as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Primary liver cancer is distinct from metastatic cancer to the liver, which originates elsewhere in the body. Liver cancer typically develops in the setting of chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis.

### Classification Systems

**Primary Liver Cancer Types**:
- **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**: Most common type (~75-85% of cases)
- **Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)**: Arising from bile duct cells within the liver (~10-15%)
- **Fibrolamellar HCC**: Rare variant occurring in young adults without cirrhosis (<1%)
- **Hepatoblastoma**: Primarily affects children (<1% of adult liver cancers)
- **Angiosarcoma and Hemangiosarcoma**: Rare vascular tumors (<1%)
- **Combined Hepatocellular-Cholangiocarcinoma**: Mixed tumor type (rare)

**Etiology and Risk Factors**:
- **Viral Hepatitis**:
  - Hepatitis B (HBV)
  - Hepatitis C (HCV)
- **Cirrhosis** from any cause:
  - Alcoholic liver disease
  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
  - Hereditary hemochromatosis
  - Primary biliary cholangitis
  - Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
  - Autoimmune hepatitis
- **Other Risk Factors**:
  - Aflatoxin exposure
  - Metabolic syndrome/diabetes
  - Obesity

**TNM Staging System (AJCC 8th Edition for HCC)**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumor
  - T1: Solitary tumor ≤2 cm, or >2 cm without vascular invasion
    - T1a: Solitary tumor ≤2 cm
    - T1b: Solitary tumor >2 cm without vascular invasion
  - T2: Solitary tumor >2 cm with vascular invasion, or multiple tumors, none >5 cm
  - T3: Multiple tumors, at least one >5 cm
  - T4: Single tumor or multiple tumors of any size involving a major branch of the portal vein or hepatic vein, or invasion of adjacent organs other than the gallbladder, or perforation of visceral peritoneum

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Regional lymph node metastasis

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis

**Stage Grouping for HCC**:
- **Stage IA**: T1a, N0, M0
- **Stage IB**: T1b, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage IIIA**: T3, N0, M0
- **Stage IIIB**: T4, N0, M0
- **Stage IVA**: Any T, N1, M0
- **Stage IVB**: Any T, Any N, M1

**Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging System**:
- **Stage 0 (Very Early)**: Single tumor <2 cm, Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0
- **Stage A (Early)**: Single tumor or ≤3 nodules ≤3 cm, Child-Pugh A-B, ECOG PS 0
- **Stage B (Intermediate)**: Multinodular, Child-Pugh A-B, ECOG PS 0
- **Stage C (Advanced)**: Portal invasion, N1, M1, Child-Pugh A-B, ECOG PS 1-2
- **Stage D (Terminal)**: Child-Pugh C, ECOG PS 3-4

**Child-Pugh Classification for Liver Function Assessment**:
- **Class A**: 5-6 points (well-compensated)
- **Class B**: 7-9 points (significant functional compromise)
- **Class C**: 10-15 points (decompensated)

**Milan Criteria** (for transplant eligibility):
- Single tumor ≤5 cm, or
- Up to 3 tumors each ≤3 cm
- No macrovascular invasion
- No extrahepatic spread
