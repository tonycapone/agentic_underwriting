# Endometrial Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Endometrial Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the epithelial lining of the uterus (endometrium). It is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries. Most cases are diagnosed at an early stage due to early symptom presentation (abnormal uterine bleeding), resulting in generally favorable outcomes. However, certain histologic subtypes and advanced-stage disease carry significantly worse prognoses.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Type I Endometrial Carcinomas** (approximately 80% of cases):
  - **Endometrioid adenocarcinoma**: Most common type, estrogen-dependent, often preceded by endometrial hyperplasia
  - Variants of endometrioid adenocarcinoma:
    - With squamous differentiation
    - Villoglandular
    - Secretory
    - Ciliated cell

- **Type II Endometrial Carcinomas** (approximately 20% of cases):
  - **Serous carcinoma**: Aggressive, not estrogen-dependent, resembles ovarian serous carcinoma
  - **Clear cell carcinoma**: Aggressive, poor prognosis
  - **Carcinosarcoma/Malignant mixed Müllerian tumor (MMMT)**: Contains both carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements
  - **Undifferentiated carcinoma**: Lacks differentiation, aggressive behavior
  - **Dedifferentiated carcinoma**: Shows both undifferentiated and differentiated components

- **Other Histological Types**:
  - Mucinous adenocarcinoma
  - Squamous cell carcinoma
  - Neuroendocrine tumors
  - Mixed cell adenocarcinoma

**WHO Classification** (2020):
- Endometrioid carcinoma
- Serous carcinoma
- Clear cell carcinoma
- Mucinous carcinoma
- Mixed cell adenocarcinoma
- Undifferentiated and dedifferentiated carcinoma
- Neuroendocrine tumors
- Carcinosarcoma

**FIGO Grading System** (for endometrioid carcinomas):
- **Grade 1**: ≤5% of non-squamous, solid growth pattern
- **Grade 2**: 6-50% of non-squamous, solid growth pattern
- **Grade 3**: >50% of non-squamous, solid growth pattern
- Note: Notable nuclear atypia inappropriate for the architectural grade raises the grade by 1

**FIGO/TNM Staging System (2018)**:
- **Stage I**: Tumor confined to the corpus uteri
  - **IA**: No or less than half of the myometrium involved
  - **IB**: Invasion equal to or more than half of the myometrium
- **Stage II**: Tumor invades cervical stroma, but does not extend beyond the uterus
- **Stage III**: Local and/or regional spread of the tumor
  - **IIIA**: Tumor invades the serosa of the corpus uteri and/or adnexae
  - **IIIB**: Vaginal involvement and/or parametrial involvement
  - **IIIC**: Metastases to pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes
    - **IIIC1**: Positive pelvic nodes
    - **IIIC2**: Positive para-aortic nodes with or without positive pelvic nodes
- **Stage IV**: Tumor invades bladder and/or bowel mucosa, and/or distant metastases
  - **IVA**: Tumor invasion of bladder and/or bowel mucosa
  - **IVB**: Distant metastasis, including intra-abdominal metastases and/or inguinal lymph nodes

**Molecular Classification** (The Cancer Genome Atlas):
- **POLE (polymerase-epsilon) ultramutated**: Excellent prognosis
- **Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)**: Intermediate prognosis
- **Copy-number low**: Intermediate prognosis
- **Copy-number high (serous-like)**: Poor prognosis

**ProMisE Classification** (Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer):
- POLE-mutated (POLEmut)
- Mismatch repair deficient (MMRd)
- p53 abnormal (p53abn)
- No specific molecular profile (NSMP)
