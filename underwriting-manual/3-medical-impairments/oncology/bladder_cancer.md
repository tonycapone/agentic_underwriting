# Bladder Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Bladder Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the urothelial cells lining the urinary bladder. Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract and has a high recurrence rate.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Urothelial Carcinoma (Transitional Cell Carcinoma)**: Most common type (>90% of cases)
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Associated with chronic irritation and infection
- **Adenocarcinoma**: Rare, often associated with bladder exstrophy
- **Small Cell Carcinoma**: Aggressive neuroendocrine tumor
- **Sarcoma**: Extremely rare mesenchymal tumors
- **Mixed Histology**: Combination of different histological types

**Grading System**:
- **Low-grade**: Well-differentiated cells, slower growth, lower risk of progression
- **High-grade**: Poorly differentiated cells, more aggressive, higher risk of progression

**Depth of Invasion**:
- **Non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC)**:
  - **Ta**: Non-invasive papillary carcinoma
  - **Tis**: Carcinoma in situ (CIS), flat high-grade tumor
  - **T1**: Tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue (lamina propria)
- **Muscle-invasive (MIBC)**:
  - **T2**: Tumor invades muscularis propria
  - **T3**: Tumor extends beyond muscularis propria
  - **T4**: Tumor invades adjacent organs

**TNM Staging System**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - Ta: Non-invasive papillary carcinoma
  - Tis: Carcinoma in situ (CIS)
  - T1: Tumor invades subepithelial connective tissue

    - T3a: Microscopically
    - T3b: Macroscopically (extravesical mass)
  - T4: Tumor invades any of the following: prostatic stroma, seminal vesicles, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, or abdominal wall
    - T4a: Prostatic stroma, seminal vesicles, uterus, or vagina
    - T4b: Pelvic wall or abdominal wall

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis in a single lymph node in the true pelvis
  - N2: Metastasis in multiple lymph nodes in the true pelvis
  - N3: Metastasis in common iliac lymph node(s)

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis
    - M1a: Non-regional lymph nodes
    - M1b: Other distant metastases

**Stage Grouping**:
- **Stage 0a**: Ta, N0, M0
- **Stage 0is**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0

- **Stage IVA**: T4b, Any N, M0 or Any T, Any N, M1a
- **Stage IVB**: Any T, Any N, M1b

**Risk Stratification for NMIBC**:
