# Esophageal Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Esophageal Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the epithelial cells lining the esophagus. It is characterized by aggressive local invasion, early lymphatic spread, and a tendency for distant metastasis. Esophageal cancer is typically diagnosed at advanced stages and has historically been associated with poor outcomes, though survival has improved with modern multimodality treatment approaches.

### Classification Systems

**Histological Types**:
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: 
  - More common globally (~90% of cases worldwide)
  - Typically occurs in the upper and middle esophagus
  - Risk factors: alcohol consumption, tobacco use, hot beverage consumption, poor oral hygiene
  - More common in Eastern Asia, Eastern Africa, and parts of South America

- **Adenocarcinoma (AC)**:
  - Predominant type in Western countries (>60% of cases in the US and Europe)
  - Typically occurs in the lower esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
  - Risk factors: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus, obesity
  - Increasing incidence in Western populations

- **Rare Types**:
  - Adenosquamous carcinoma
  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
  - Small cell carcinoma
  - Sarcomatoid carcinoma
  - Melanoma
  - Lymphoma
  - Neuroendocrine tumors

**Anatomical Location**:
- **Upper esophagus**: Cervical esophagus to 18 cm from incisors
- **Middle esophagus**: 18-32 cm from incisors
- **Lower esophagus**: 32 cm from incisors to gastroesophageal junction
- **Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ)**:
  - Siewert Classification for GEJ tumors:
    - **Type I**: Adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, center located 1-5 cm above the GEJ
    - **Type II**: True cardia carcinoma, center located within 1 cm above and 2 cm below the GEJ
    - **Type III**: Subcardial gastric carcinoma, center located 2-5 cm below the GEJ

**TNM Staging System (AJCC 8th Edition)**:

For Squamous Cell Carcinoma:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - Tis: High-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ
  - T1: Tumor invades lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, or submucosa
    - T1a: Tumor invades lamina propria or muscularis mucosae
    - T1b: Tumor invades submucosa
  - T2: Tumor invades muscularis propria
  - T3: Tumor invades adventitia
  - T4: Tumor invades adjacent structures
    - T4a: Tumor invades pleura, pericardium, azygos vein, diaphragm, or peritoneum
    - T4b: Tumor invades other adjacent structures (aorta, vertebral body, trachea)

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis in 1-2 regional lymph nodes
  - N2: Metastasis in 3-6 regional lymph nodes
  - N3: Metastasis in â‰¥7 regional lymph nodes

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis

For Adenocarcinoma:
- T, N, and M classifications are the same as for SCC, but stage groupings differ slightly.

**Stage Grouping for SCC**:
- **Stage 0**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2-3, N0, M0 or T1-2, N1, M0
- **Stage III**: T1-2, N2, M0 or T3, N1-2, M0 or T4a, N0-2, M0
- **Stage IVA**: Any T, N3, M0 or T4b, Any N, M0
- **Stage IVB**: Any T, Any N, M1

**Stage Grouping for Adenocarcinoma** (slightly different from SCC):
- **Stage 0**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage IIA**: T1, N1, M0
- **Stage IIB**: T2, N0, M0 or T1, N2, M0
- **Stage III**: T2, N1-2, M0 or T3-4a, N0-2, M0
- **Stage IVA**: Any T, N3, M0 or T4b, Any N, M0
- **Stage IVB**: Any T, Any N, M1

**Histologic Grade**:
- GX: Grade cannot be assessed
- G1: Well differentiated
- G2: Moderately differentiated
- G3: Poorly differentiated
- G4: Undifferentiated

**Barrett's Esophagus Classification**:
- Non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus
- Low-grade dysplasia (LGD)
- High-grade dysplasia (HGD)
- Intramucosal carcinoma
