# Colorectal Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Colorectal Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum. Colorectal cancer typically develops from adenomatous polyps and is one of the most common cancers worldwide.

### Classification Systems

**Anatomical Location**:
- **Colon Cancer**:
  - Right colon (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure)
  - Transverse colon
  - Left colon (splenic flexure, descending colon)
  - Sigmoid colon
- **Rectal Cancer**: Cancer arising in the rectum (typically within 15 cm of the anal verge)
- **Rectosigmoid Junction**: Cancer at the junction between sigmoid colon and rectum

**Histological Types**:
- **Adenocarcinoma**: Most common type (>95% of cases)
- **Mucinous Adenocarcinoma**: Contains >50% mucin
- **Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma**: Rare, aggressive variant
- **Medullary Carcinoma**: Associated with microsatellite instability
- **Neuroendocrine Tumors**: Rare, arising from neuroendocrine cells
- **Other rare types**: Squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma

**TNM Staging System**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - Tis: Carcinoma in situ (intraepithelial or invasion of lamina propria)
  - T1: Invasion into submucosa
  - T2: Invasion into muscularis propria
  - T3: Invasion through muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues
  - T4a: Penetration to the surface of the visceral peritoneum
  - T4b: Direct invasion of other organs or structures

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis in 1-3 regional lymph nodes
    - N1a: Metastasis in 1 regional lymph node
    - N1b: Metastasis in 2-3 regional lymph nodes
    - N1c: Tumor deposits in subserosa, mesentery, or non-peritonealized tissues without regional nodal metastasis
  - N2: Metastasis in 4 or more regional lymph nodes
    - N2a: Metastasis in 4-6 regional lymph nodes
    - N2b: Metastasis in 7 or more regional lymph nodes

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis
    - M1a: Metastasis confined to one organ without peritoneal metastasis
    - M1b: Metastasis to two or more sites without peritoneal metastasis
    - M1c: Metastasis to the peritoneal surface with or without other organ involvement
