# Leukemia

## Definition & Classification

**Leukemia**: A group of cancers that begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells. These abnormal cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells. Different types of leukemia exist, with varying clinical courses, treatment approaches, and prognoses.

### Major Types of Leukemia

**Acute Leukemias** (rapidly progressing):
- **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**: Affects lymphoid cells; common in children
  - B-cell ALL (most common)
  - T-cell ALL
  - Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL
- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: Affects myeloid cells; more common in adults
  - Multiple subtypes based on WHO classification
  - Classified by cytogenetic and molecular features

**Chronic Leukemias** (slowly progressing):
- **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Most common adult leukemia; affects B lymphocytes
- **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: Characterized by BCR-ABL1 fusion gene
- **Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL)**: Rare chronic B-cell leukemia
- **Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia (LGL)**: Rare chronic leukemia

**Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)**: Pre-leukemic disorders with risk of progression to AML
- Low-risk MDS
- High-risk MDS

**Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN)** with leukemic features:
- Essential thrombocythemia (ET)
- Polycythemia vera (PV)
- Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)

### Classification Systems

**Acute Leukemias**:
- **WHO Classification**: Based on morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, genetics
- **French-American-British (FAB) Classification**: Based on cell morphology and maturity

**Chronic Leukemias**:
- **Rai Staging** (CLL): Stages 0-IV based on lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenia
- **Binet Staging** (CLL): Stages A-C based on number of affected sites and cytopenia
- **European LeukemiaNet Criteria** (CML): Based on response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors

**Risk Stratification**:
- Based on cytogenetics, molecular markers, and response to treatment
- Favorable, intermediate, or adverse risk groups
