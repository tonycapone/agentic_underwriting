# Head and Neck Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Head and Neck Cancer**: A group of malignant neoplasms arising from the mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, pharynx (oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx), larynx, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, and salivary glands. These cancers share similar risk factors, diagnostic approaches, therapeutic strategies, and prognostic factors.

### Classification Systems

**Anatomical Sites**:
- **Oral Cavity**: Lips, anterior two-thirds of tongue, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, hard palate, retromolar trigone, alveolar ridges
- **Oropharynx**: Base of tongue, tonsils, soft palate, posterior pharyngeal wall
- **Nasopharynx**: Superior portion of the pharynx behind the nasal cavity
- **Hypopharynx**: Piriform sinuses, postcricoid area, posterior pharyngeal wall
- **Larynx**: Supraglottis, glottis, subglottis
- **Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses**: Maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, frontal sinuses
- **Salivary Glands**: Parotid, submandibular, sublingual, minor salivary glands

**Histological Types**:
- **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: Most common, 90% of head and neck cancers
  - Conventional (keratinizing)
  - Non-keratinizing
  - Basaloid
  - Papillary
  - Spindle cell (sarcomatoid)
  - Verrucous
  - Adenosquamous

- **Salivary Gland Neoplasms**:
  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma
  - Acinic cell carcinoma
  - Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS)
  - Salivary duct carcinoma
  - Polymorphous adenocarcinoma
  - Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma

- **Other Histological Types**:
  - Lymphoepithelial carcinoma (especially in nasopharynx)
  - Neuroendocrine carcinomas
  - Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma
  - Olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma)
  - Melanoma
  - Lymphoma

**Etiological Classification**:
- **HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer**: Better prognosis, increasing incidence
- **HPV-Negative Cancer**: Associated with smoking/alcohol, worse prognosis
- **EBV-Associated Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**: Endemic in certain populations
- **Environment/Occupation-Associated**: Wood dust, leather, nickel exposure

**TNM Staging System (AJCC 8th Edition)**:
- Separate staging systems for:
  - Lip and oral cavity
  - Oropharynx (p16-positive and p16-negative)
  - Hypopharynx
  - Nasopharynx
  - Larynx
  - Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity
  - Salivary glands

**General TNM Framework**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - Tx: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumor
  - Tis: Carcinoma in situ
  - T1-T4: Increasing size and/or local extension of the primary tumor
- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - Nx: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1-N3: Increasing involvement of regional lymph nodes
- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis

**Stage Grouping**:
- **Stage 0**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage I**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T3, N0, M0 or T1-3, N1, M0
- **Stage IVA**: T4a, N0-1, M0 or T1-4a, N2, M0
- **Stage IVB**: T4b, Any N, M0 or Any T, N3, M0
- **Stage IVC**: Any T, Any N, M1

**Note**: HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers have a distinct staging system reflecting their better prognosis

**Histologic Grade**:
- G1: Well differentiated
- G2: Moderately differentiated
- G3: Poorly differentiated
- G4: Undifferentiated
