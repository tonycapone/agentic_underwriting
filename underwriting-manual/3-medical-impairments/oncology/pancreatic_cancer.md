# Pancreatic Cancer

## Definition & Classification

**Pancreatic Cancer**: A malignant neoplasm arising from the cells of the pancreas, a glandular organ located in the abdomen that produces digestive enzymes and hormones including insulin. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies with a poor overall survival rate due to late-stage diagnosis in the majority of cases.

### Classification Systems

**Anatomical Location**:
- **Exocrine Pancreatic Cancer**: 
  - **Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)**: Arising from the ductal epithelium (>90% of pancreatic cancers)
  - **Location-based classification**:
    - Head of pancreas (60-70%)
    - Body of pancreas (10-15%)
    - Tail of pancreas (10-15%)
    - Diffuse involvement (5-10%)

- **Endocrine Pancreatic Cancer (Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors, PNETs)**: 
  - Arising from islet cells (<5% of pancreatic cancers)
  - Can be functional (insulin-producing, gastrin-producing, etc.) or non-functional

**Histological Types**:
- **Exocrine Tumors**:
  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
  - Acinar cell carcinoma
  - Adenosquamous carcinoma
  - Colloid carcinoma (mucinous non-cystic)
  - Hepatoid carcinoma
  - Medullary carcinoma
  - Signet ring cell carcinoma
  - Undifferentiated carcinoma
  - Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells

- **Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms**:
  - Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)
  - Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN)
  - Serous cystadenoma
  - Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm

- **Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNETs)**:
  - Functional: Insulinoma, Gastrinoma, Glucagonoma, VIPoma, Somatostatinoma
  - Non-functional PNETs

**TNM Staging System (AJCC 8th Edition)**:
- **T (Primary Tumor)**:
  - TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumor
  - Tis: Carcinoma in situ (includes PanIN-3)
  - T1: Tumor ≤2 cm in greatest dimension
    - T1a: Tumor ≤0.5 cm in greatest dimension
    - T1b: Tumor >0.5 cm and <1 cm in greatest dimension
    - T1c: Tumor 1-2 cm in greatest dimension
  - T2: Tumor >2 cm and ≤4 cm in greatest dimension
  - T3: Tumor >4 cm in greatest dimension
  - T4: Tumor involves celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and/or common hepatic artery

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
  - N0: No regional lymph node metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis in 1-3 regional lymph nodes
  - N2: Metastasis in ≥4 regional lymph nodes

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: No distant metastasis
  - M1: Distant metastasis

**Stage Grouping**:
- **Stage 0**: Tis, N0, M0
- **Stage IA**: T1, N0, M0
- **Stage IB**: T2, N0, M0
- **Stage IIA**: T3, N0, M0

- **Stage IV**: Any T, Any N, M1

**Resectability Status** (critical for treatment decisions):
- **Resectable**: No arterial involvement, no venous involvement or reconstructible venous involvement
- **Borderline Resectable**: Limited arterial involvement, venous involvement that is reconstructible
- **Locally Advanced/Unresectable**: Extensive arterial or venous involvement that precludes resection
- **Metastatic**: Presence of distant metastases

**WHO Grading System for PNETs**:
- **G1**: Ki-67 index <3% and/or mitotic count <2 per 10 HPF
- **G2**: Ki-67 index 3-20% and/or mitotic count 2-20 per 10 HPF

| **Platinum Agents** | Oxaliplatin, Cisplatin | Used in FOLFIRINOX, standard regimen for advanced PDAC |
| **Taxanes** | Paclitaxel, Docetaxel, Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) | Used in standard regimens for advanced PDAC |
| **Topoisomerase Inhibitors** | Irinotecan, Liposomal irinotecan (Onivyde) | Used in FOLFIRINOX and second-line therapy |
| **Targeted Therapy** | Erlotinib (Tarceva) | Limited use in specific cases of advanced PDAC |
