# Proteinuria

## Definition & Classification

**Proteinuria**: The presence of excessive protein in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage or disease. Normal protein excretion is typically less than 150 mg per day.

### Classification by Quantity

- **Normal Protein Excretion**: <150 mg/24 hours or <30 mg/g creatinine (ACR)
- **Microalbuminuria**: 30-300 mg/g creatinine (ACR)
- **Proteinuria**: >300 mg/g creatinine (ACR)
- **Sub-nephrotic Proteinuria**: 300-3500 mg/24 hours
- **Nephrotic-Range Proteinuria**: >3500 mg/24 hours
- **Massive Proteinuria**: >10,000 mg/24 hours

### Classification by Pattern

- **Transient Proteinuria**: Temporary increase often due to fever, exercise, dehydration, stress
- **Orthostatic Proteinuria**: Occurs in upright position but not when lying down
- **Persistent Proteinuria**: Present on multiple occasions over time
- **Isolated Proteinuria**: Proteinuria without other urinary abnormalities or reduced kidney function
- **Proteinuria with Hematuria**: Suggests glomerular disease
- **Proteinuria with Reduced GFR**: Indicates more significant kidney damage

### Classification by Origin

- **Glomerular Proteinuria**: Due to increased glomerular permeability to proteins
  - **Selective Proteinuria**: Primarily albumin (e.g., minimal change disease)
  - **Non-selective Proteinuria**: Multiple protein types (e.g., membranous nephropathy)
- **Tubular Proteinuria**: Due to decreased tubular reabsorption of normally filtered proteins
- **Overflow Proteinuria**: Due to increased plasma concentrations of low molecular weight proteins
- **Post-renal Proteinuria**: Due to protein addition in the lower urinary tract

8. Significant proteinuria with systemic disease flare

### Decline

1. Nephrotic syndrome unresponsive to treatment with declining renal function
2. Proteinuria >3.5 g/day with eGFR <30 ml/min
3. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
4. Proteinuria due to amyloidosis with organ dysfunction
5. End-stage renal disease requiring dialysis
6. Multiple treatment failures for primary glomerular disease
7. Proteinuria with severe hypoalbuminemia and complications

## Laboratory Considerations

| Test | Significance | Underwriting Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Urine Dipstick** | Screening test | Semi-quantitative; requires confirmation; false positives from concentrated urine, alkaline pH |
| **Spot Urine Protein** | Random sample | May vary with hydration; less reliable than ACR |
| **Spot Urine ACR** | Ratio normalizes for concentration | Preferred screening; correlates well with 24-hour protein |
| **24-hour Urine Protein** | Gold standard | Most accurate quantification; difficult to collect properly |
| **Urine Protein Electrophoresis** | Protein types | Helps distinguish glomerular from tubular proteinuria |
| **Serum Albumin** | Protein loss | Low levels suggest significant proteinuria |
| **Lipid Panel** | Secondary effect | Hyperlipidemia may indicate nephrotic syndrome |
| **Renal Function Tests** | Kidney damage | BUN, creatinine, eGFR help assess severity |
| **Urine Sediment** | Associated findings | RBCs, casts indicate glomerular inflammation |
| **Complement Levels** | Immune complexes | Low C3/C4 suggest immune-mediated disease |
