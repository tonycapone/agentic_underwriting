# Genito-Urinary Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting genito-urinary conditions, including:

## Common Genito-Urinary Conditions

- [Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)](ckd.md): Progressive loss of kidney function classified into stages based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
- [Proteinuria](proteinuria.md): Excess protein in urine, which may indicate kidney damage or disease.
- [Kidney Transplant](kidney_transplant.md): Surgical procedure to place a healthy kidney from a donor into a person with kidney failure.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and staging**: Specific condition, CKD stage, and diagnostic criteria
2. **Disease stability**: Progression rate, stability of renal function, and trend in laboratory values
3. **Etiology**: Underlying cause of the renal condition (diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, etc.)
4. **Treatment regimen**: Medications, dialysis, transplantation, and response to treatment
5. **Complications**: Anemia, mineral and bone disorders, cardiovascular complications, electrolyte imbalances
6. **Comorbidities**: Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions affecting renal prognosis
7. **Monitoring**: Frequency of follow-up and adherence to recommended monitoring

## Evidence Requirements

- Nephrologist consultation reports
- Laboratory test results (BUN, creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis, proteinuria quantification)
- Imaging studies (ultrasound, CT, MRI)
- Biopsy results (if performed)
- Dialysis records (if applicable)
- Transplant records and post-transplant monitoring (if applicable)
- Current medication list
- Evidence of regular follow-up and monitoring
- Assessment of complications or associated conditions

## General Approach

Genito-urinary conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, severity, progression rate, stability, and complications. Ratings range from standard for mild, stable conditions with normal or minimally reduced renal function to significant ratings or decline for advanced disease with significant renal dysfunction or complications. Transplant cases are evaluated based on time since transplant, stability of graft function, immunosuppression regimen, and presence of complications.
