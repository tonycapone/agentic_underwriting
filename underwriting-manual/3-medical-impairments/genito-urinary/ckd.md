# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

## Definition & Classification

**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**: A condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time, defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for >3 months, with implications for health.

### Classification Systems

**KDIGO Classification by GFR and Albuminuria Categories**:

**GFR Categories**:
- **G1**: Normal or high (≥90 mL/min/1.73m²)
- **G2**: Mildly decreased (60-89 mL/min/1.73m²)
- **G3a**: Mildly to moderately decreased (45-59 mL/min/1.73m²)
- **G3b**: Moderately to severely decreased (30-44 mL/min/1.73m²)
- **G4**: Severely decreased (15-29 mL/min/1.73m²)
- **G5**: Kidney failure (<15 mL/min/1.73m²)

**Albuminuria Categories**:

## Laboratory Considerations

| Test | Significance | Underwriting Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Serum Creatinine** | Kidney excretory function | Elevated values suggest kidney impairment; must be interpreted with age, gender, muscle mass |
| **eGFR** | Calculated estimate of kidney filtration | Most reliable single measure of kidney function; assess value and trend over time |
| **BUN** | Nitrogen waste clearance | Elevated with kidney impairment; affected by protein intake, catabolism, volume status |
| **Urine ACR** | Measure of kidney damage | Persistent elevation indicates kidney damage regardless of eGFR |
| **Hemoglobin** | Kidney's erythropoietin production | Anemia may indicate more advanced CKD |
| **Serum Albumin** | Nutrition and inflammation | Low levels may indicate poor prognosis in CKD |
| **Potassium** | Kidney's ability to excrete potassium | Hyperkalemia indicates declining function or complications |
| **Bicarbonate** | Acid-base balance | Low levels indicate metabolic acidosis from kidney dysfunction |
| **Calcium/Phosphate** | Mineral balance | Abnormalities indicate mineral bone disorder of CKD |
| **Parathyroid Hormone** | Calcium-phosphate regulation | Elevated levels indicate secondary hyperparathyroidism of CKD |
