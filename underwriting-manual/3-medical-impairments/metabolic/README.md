# Metabolic Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting metabolic conditions, including:

## Common Metabolic Conditions

- [Type 1 Diabetes](type1_diabetes.md): Autoimmune condition characterized by insulin deficiency requiring exogenous insulin for survival.
- [Type 2 Diabetes](type2_diabetes.md): Metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose due to insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.
- [Obesity](obesity.md): Excess body fat accumulation that presents a risk to health, defined by Body Mass Index (BMI) and other metrics.
- [Metabolic Syndrome](metabolic_syndrome.md): Cluster of conditions including increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and duration**: Type of condition, age at onset, and duration of disease
2. **Control**: Laboratory values (HbA1c, glucose, lipids) and stability over time
3. **Complications**: Presence of micro or macrovascular complications
4. **Treatment regimen**: Medication type, dosage, and adherence
5. **Comorbidities**: Concurrent cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, or other conditions
6. **Lifestyle factors**: Diet, exercise, smoking status, and alcohol use
7. **Monitoring**: Frequency of follow-up with healthcare providers and self-monitoring practices

## Evidence Requirements

- Laboratory tests (HbA1c, fasting glucose, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid profile)
- Height, weight, and BMI measurements
- Specialist reports
- Treatment details and medication history
- Screening results for complications
- History of hospitalizations related to metabolic conditions

## General Approach

Metabolic conditions are evaluated based on type, severity, control, complications, and risk factors. Ratings range from standard for well-controlled conditions without complications to significant ratings or decline for poorly controlled disease with advanced complications.
