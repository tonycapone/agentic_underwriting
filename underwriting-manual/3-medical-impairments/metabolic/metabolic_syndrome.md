# Metabolic Syndrome

## Definition & Classification

**Metabolic Syndrome**: A cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when a person has three or more of the following risk factors.

### Classification Systems

**National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) Criteria**:

Three or more of the following:
1. Abdominal obesity: Waist circumference ≥40 inches (102 cm) in men or ≥35 inches (88 cm) in women
2. Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or drug treatment for elevated triglycerides
3. HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men or <50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in women or drug treatment for low HDL
4. Blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg or drug treatment for hypertension
5. Fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or drug treatment for elevated glucose

**International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Criteria**:

Central obesity (defined by waist circumference with ethnicity-specific values) plus any two of the following:
1. Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or specific treatment
2. HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men or <50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in women or specific treatment
3. Blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg or treatment for hypertension
4. Fasting plasma glucose ≥100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Anthropometric measurements**:
   - Height and weight for BMI calculation
   - Waist circumference
   - Blood pressure readings

2. **Laboratory values**:
   - Fasting glucose or HbA1c
   - Lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides)
   - Liver function tests

3. **Medical history** including:
   - Duration of metabolic abnormalities
   - Family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease
   - Treatment history for individual components
   - Lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, smoking)

4. **Medication history**:
   - Antihypertensive medications
   - Lipid-lowering medications
   - Glucose-lowering medications
   - Weight management medications

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Insulin levels or HOMA-IR (insulin resistance assessment)
- Inflammatory markers (hs-CRP)
- Liver imaging for fatty liver assessment
- Cardiovascular risk assessment (stress test, coronary calcium score)
- Sleep study results if sleep apnea suspected

## Rating Guidelines

| Hypertension | 130-139/85-89 mmHg | 140-159/90-99 mmHg | ≥160/100 mmHg |
| Hyperglycemia | FPG 100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c 5.7-6.0% | FPG 126-139 mg/dL or HbA1c 6.1-6.4% | FPG ≥140 mg/dL or HbA1c ≥6.5% |

**Severity-Based Rating Adjustment**:
- Predominantly mild components: Lower end of range
- Predominantly moderate components: Middle of range
- Predominantly severe components: Upper end of range or +25 points

### Treatment Response

| Treatment Status | Rating Adjustment |
|------------------|-------------------|
| No treatment | +25 points |
| Partial treatment (some components addressed) | No adjustment |
| Comprehensive treatment with partial response | -25 points |
| Comprehensive treatment with good response | -50 points |
| Lifestyle modification with documented improvement | -25 to -50 points |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Recently diagnosed metabolic syndrome (<3 months) without established treatment plan
2. Recent significant change in treatment regimen (<3 months)
3. Pending evaluation for cardiovascular disease
4. Severely uncontrolled individual components pending stabilization

### Decline

1. Metabolic syndrome with:
   - Established coronary artery disease with unstable symptoms
   - History of stroke with significant residual deficits
   - Advanced heart failure (NYHA Class III-IV)
   - Severe diabetic complications
   - End-stage renal disease

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Class | Underwriting Significance |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Statins | Standard treatment for dyslipidemia component |
| Fibrates | May indicate more severe triglyceride elevation |
