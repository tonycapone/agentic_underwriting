# Obesity

## Definition & Classification

**Obesity**: A chronic disease characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat that presents a risk to health. Obesity is typically measured using Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, and assessment of associated health conditions.

### Classification Systems

**Body Mass Index (BMI) Classification**:

| BMI (kg/m²) | Classification |
|-------------|----------------|
| <18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5-24.9 | Normal weight |
| 25.0-29.9 | Overweight |
| 30.0-34.9 | Obesity Class I (Moderate) |
| 35.0-39.9 | Obesity Class II (Severe) |
| ≥40.0 | Obesity Class III (Very severe/Morbid) |

**Waist Circumference Risk Classification**:

| Gender | Increased Risk | Substantially Increased Risk |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Men | ≥94 cm (≥37 inches) | ≥102 cm (≥40 inches) |
| Women | ≥80 cm (≥31.5 inches) | ≥88 cm (≥34.5 inches) |

**Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS)**:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 | No apparent obesity-related risk factors, symptoms, or functional limitations |
| 1 | Presence of obesity-related subclinical risk factors |
| 2 | Presence of established obesity-related chronic disease |
| 3 | Established end-organ damage |
| 4 | Severe disabilities from obesity-related chronic disease |

## Required Evidence
