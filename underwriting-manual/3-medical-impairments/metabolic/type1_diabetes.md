# Type 1 Diabetes

## Definition & Classification

**Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)**: An autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency. Type 1 diabetes typically presents in childhood or early adulthood and requires lifelong insulin therapy.

### Classification Systems

**American Diabetes Association Diagnostic Criteria**:

| Test | Diabetes |
|------|----------|
| Fasting Plasma Glucose | ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour Plasma Glucose (OGTT) | ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) |
| HbA1c | ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) |
| Random Plasma Glucose | ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) with symptoms |

**Type 1 Diabetes-Specific Markers**:
- Presence of autoantibodies (GAD, IA-2, IAA, ZnT8)
- Low or undetectable C-peptide levels
- Absence of insulin resistance markers

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Age at diagnosis
   - Confirmation of Type 1 vs. Type 2 diabetes
   - Initial presentation and circumstances

2. **Glycemic control**:
   - Recent HbA1c (within 3-6 months)
   - Blood glucose monitoring records
   - History of HbA1c values (trend)
   - Frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes

3. **Treatment regimen**:
   - Insulin type(s) and dosage
   - Delivery method (injections, pump, hybrid closed-loop)
   - Continuous glucose monitoring usage
   - Carbohydrate counting/management

4. **Complications screening**:
   - Retinal examination results
   - Kidney function tests (eGFR, urine albumin)
   - Neurological examination
   - Cardiovascular assessment

5. **Self-management assessment**:
   - Frequency of blood glucose monitoring
   - Hypoglycemia awareness
   - Diabetes education participation
   - Adherence to medical follow-up

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Continuous glucose monitoring data analysis
- Detailed ophthalmology reports
- Cardiac stress test results
- Peripheral vascular studies
- Autonomic neuropathy assessment
