# Type 2 Diabetes

## Definition & Classification

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**: A chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, resulting in hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 90-95% of all diabetes cases and is strongly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and family history.

### Classification Systems

**American Diabetes Association Diagnostic Criteria**:

| Test | Diabetes | Prediabetes |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Fasting Plasma Glucose | ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) | 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour Plasma Glucose (OGTT) | ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) | 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L) |
| HbA1c | ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) | 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol) |
| Random Plasma Glucose | ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) with symptoms | N/A |

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Laboratory evidence of diabetes diagnosis
   - Date of diagnosis
   - Initial presentation (routine screening vs. symptomatic)

2. **Glycemic control**:
   - Recent HbA1c (within 6 months)
   - Fasting blood glucose readings
   - History of HbA1c values (trend)

3. **Treatment regimen**:
   - Current medications and dosages
   - Duration of current regimen
   - History of treatment changes
   - Compliance with treatment

4. **Complications screening**:
   - Retinal examination results
   - Kidney function tests (eGFR, urine albumin)
   - Neurological examination
   - Cardiovascular assessment

5. **Risk factor management**:
   - Blood pressure control
   - Lipid profile
   - BMI/weight management
   - Smoking status

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Continuous glucose monitoring data
- Detailed ophthalmology reports
- Cardiac stress test results
- Peripheral vascular studies
- Detailed neurological assessment
