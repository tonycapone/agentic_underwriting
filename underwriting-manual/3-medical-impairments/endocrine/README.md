# Endocrine Conditions - Underwriting Guidelines

This section provides detailed guidelines for underwriting endocrine conditions, including:

## Common Endocrine Conditions

- [Thyroid Disorders](thyroid_disorders.md): Including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, and thyroid nodules/cancer.
- [Adrenal Disorders](adrenal_disorders.md): Including Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and adrenal insufficiency.
- [Pituitary Tumors](pituitary_tumors.md): Including prolactinomas, growth hormone-secreting tumors, ACTH-secreting tumors, and non-functioning adenomas.

## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and classification**: Specific condition, etiology, and diagnostic certainty
2. **Disease control**: Laboratory values, symptom control, and stability over time
3. **Treatment regimen**: Medications, surgical interventions, radiation therapy, and response to treatment
4. **Complications**: End-organ damage, cardiovascular effects, metabolic disturbances
5. **Monitoring**: Frequency of follow-up and adherence to recommended monitoring
6. **Comorbidities**: Associated endocrine or non-endocrine conditions
7. **Lifestyle impact**: Effect on daily functioning and quality of life

## Evidence Requirements

- Endocrinologist consultation reports
- Laboratory test results (hormone levels, stimulation tests, suppression tests)
- Imaging studies (MRI, CT, ultrasound, nuclear medicine scans)
- Surgical reports for any endocrine-related procedures
- Current medication list and treatment history
- Evidence of regular follow-up and monitoring
- Assessment of complications or associated conditions

## General Approach

Endocrine conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, hormonal control, treatment effectiveness, and presence of complications. Ratings range from standard for well-controlled conditions with normal or near-normal hormone levels to significant ratings for poorly controlled disease with end-organ damage or other complications. Some conditions may require postponement until stability is achieved or decline if associated with significant mortality risk.
