# Adrenal Disorders

## Definition & Classification

**Adrenal Disorders**: Conditions affecting the adrenal glands, which produce hormones that regulate metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, stress response, and other essential functions.

### Major Types of Adrenal Disorders

**Disorders of Cortisol Excess**:
- **Cushing's Syndrome**: Prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol
  - **ACTH-dependent** (80%): Pituitary adenoma (Cushing's Disease), ectopic ACTH production
  - **ACTH-independent** (20%): Adrenal adenoma, adrenal carcinoma, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia
  - **Exogenous**: Iatrogenic due to glucocorticoid medication

**Disorders of Cortisol Deficiency**:
- **Primary Adrenal Insufficiency** (Addison's Disease): Adrenal gland failure
  - Autoimmune (70-90% in developed countries)
  - Infectious (TB, fungal, HIV)
  - Infiltrative (amyloidosis, metastases)
  - Genetic (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenoleukodystrophy)
  - Hemorrhage/infarction
  - Medication-induced
- **Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency**: Due to ACTH deficiency from pituitary or hypothalamic disease
- **Tertiary Adrenal Insufficiency**: Due to suppression of the HPA axis from exogenous glucocorticoids

**Disorders of Aldosterone Excess**:
- **Primary Hyperaldosteronism** (Conn's Syndrome)
  - Aldosterone-producing adenoma (35%)
  - Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (60%)
  - Adrenal carcinoma (rare)
  - Familial hyperaldosteronism (rare)

**Disorders of Aldosterone Deficiency**:
- Hypoaldosteronism (often with adrenal insufficiency)
- Isolated hypoaldosteronism (diabetes, medications, renal disease)

**Disorders of Adrenal Medullary Excess**:
- **Pheochromocytoma**: Tumor of the adrenal medulla producing excess catecholamines
- **Paraganglioma**: Extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma

**Disorders of Adrenal Steroids**:
- **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)**: Enzymatic defects in steroid synthesis
  - Classical (severe)
  - Non-classical (mild)

**Adrenal Incidentalomas**:
- Non-functioning adenomas
- Sub-clinical functioning adenomas
- Adrenal carcinomas
- Other adrenal masses

| **Androgen Replacement** | DHEA | Sometimes used in women with adrenal insufficiency; minimal impact |
| **Steroidogenesis Inhibitors** | Ketoconazole, Metyrapone, Mitotane | Used for Cushing's; mitotane indicates more serious disease |
| **Adrenal Steroid Receptor Antagonists** | Spironolactone, Eplerenone | Used for hyperaldosteronism; generally favorable |
| **Adrenergic Blockers** | Phenoxybenzamine, Doxazosin, Propranolol | Pre-operative management of pheochromocytoma; temporary use |
| **ACTH or CRH Antagonists** | Pasireotide, Mifepristone | Used for refractory Cushing's; indicates more severe disease |
