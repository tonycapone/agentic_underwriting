# Thyroid Disorders

## Definition & Classification

**Thyroid Disorders**: A group of conditions that affect the function of the thyroid gland, resulting in abnormal production of thyroid hormones or structural abnormalities of the gland.

### Major Types of Functional Thyroid Disorders

- **Hypothyroidism**: Underactive thyroid gland producing insufficient thyroid hormones
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Overactive thyroid gland producing excessive thyroid hormones
- **Subclinical Hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH with normal free T4, without overt symptoms
- **Subclinical Hyperthyroidism**: Low or undetectable TSH with normal free T4, without overt symptoms
- **Thyroiditis**: Inflammation of the thyroid gland, which may cause transient hyper- or hypothyroidism

### Major Types of Structural Thyroid Disorders

- **Goiter**: Enlargement of the thyroid gland
- **Thyroid Nodules**: Discrete growths within the thyroid gland
  - Solitary nodules
  - Multinodular goiter
- **Thyroid Cancer**:
  - Papillary carcinoma
  - Follicular carcinoma
  - Medullary carcinoma
  - Anaplastic carcinoma

### Etiology Classification

- **Autoimmune**: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease
- **Iodine-related**: Iodine deficiency or excess
- **Medication-induced**: Amiodarone, lithium, interferon alpha
- **Post-surgical**: Following thyroidectomy
- **Post-ablation**: Following radioactive iodine therapy
- **Congenital**: Present from birth
- **Pituitary/hypothalamic**: Secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism

## Medication Considerations

| **Beta Blockers** | Propranolol, Atenolol | Symptom control in hyperthyroidism; usually temporary |
| **Iodine Preparations** | Lugol's solution, Potassium iodide | Short-term use before surgery; prolonged use unusual |
| **Thyroid Cancer Treatments** | Tyrosine kinase inhibitors | Indicate advanced thyroid cancer; individual consideration |
