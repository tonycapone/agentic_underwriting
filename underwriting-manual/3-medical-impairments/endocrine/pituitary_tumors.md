# Pituitary Tumors

## Definition & Classification

**Pituitary Tumors**: Growths that develop in the pituitary gland, a small pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. These tumors can affect the normal production of pituitary hormones and sometimes affect surrounding brain structures.

### Tumor Types by Size

- **Microadenoma**: Tumor less than 10mm in diameter
- **Macroadenoma**: Tumor 10mm or larger in diameter
- **Giant adenoma**: Tumor greater than 40mm in diameter

### Tumor Types by Hormone Secretion

**Functioning (Hormone-Secreting) Adenomas**:
- **Prolactinoma**: Secretes excess prolactin
- **Growth Hormone (GH) Adenoma**: Causes acromegaly in adults or gigantism in children
- **Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Adenoma**: Causes Cushing's disease
- **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Adenoma**: Causes hyperthyroidism
- **Gonadotropin-Secreting Adenoma**: Secretes luteinizing hormone (LH) and/or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
- **Plurihormonal Adenoma**: Secretes multiple hormones

**Non-functioning Adenomas**:
- **Silent adenomas**: Do not produce excessive hormones or produce hormones that don't cause symptoms
- **Null cell adenomas**: Cells that don't show evidence of hormone production

### Other Sellar Region Tumors

- **Craniopharyngioma**: Benign tumor arising from embryonic tissue
- **Rathke's Cleft Cyst**: Fluid-filled cyst in the pituitary region
- **Meningioma**: Tumor arising from the meninges near the pituitary
- **Pituitary Carcinoma**: Rare malignant pituitary tumor
- **Metastases**: Spread of cancer from other body sites to pituitary region

### Classification by Invasiveness/Behavior

- **Non-invasive**: Confined to the sella turcica
- **Invasive**: Extension into surrounding structures (cavernous sinus, sphenoid sinus)
- **Aggressive**: Rapid growth, resistance to conventional therapy
- **Malignant**: Presence of cerebrospinal or systemic metastases
