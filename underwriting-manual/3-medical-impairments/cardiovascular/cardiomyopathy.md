# Cardiomyopathy

## Definition & Classification

**Cardiomyopathy**: A group of diseases affecting the heart muscle (myocardium), leading to mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually results in inadequate heart pumping or other heart rhythm abnormalities.

### Classification Systems

**By Morphological and Functional Phenotype**:
- Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM): Enlarged left ventricle with impaired contraction
- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM): Abnormal thickening of heart muscle
- Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM): Stiff ventricular walls restricting filling
- Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC): Fibrofatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium
- Left Ventricular Non-Compaction (LVNC): Prominent trabeculations and deep recesses

**By Etiology**:
- Genetic/Familial
- Acquired (ischemic, infectious, toxic, metabolic, etc.)
- Mixed (genetic predisposition with environmental triggers)
- Idiopathic (unknown cause)

**By Functional Status (New York Heart Association Classification)**:
- Class I: No limitation of physical activity
- Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity
- Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity
- Class IV: Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort
