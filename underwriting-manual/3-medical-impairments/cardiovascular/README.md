## General Cardiovascular Assessment Principles

When evaluating cardiovascular conditions, consider:

1. **Severity**: Extent of disease, functional impairment, and anatomical damage
2. **Stability**: Progression or improvement over time
3. **Treatment**: Compliance, effectiveness, and complications
4. **Risk Factor Control**: Management of hypertension, diabetes, lipids, smoking
5. **Functional Capacity**: Exercise tolerance and daily activity level
6. **Comorbidities**: Other conditions that may compound cardiovascular risk

## Key Diagnostic Tests

| Test | Significance | Normal Values |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Resting ECG | Baseline cardiac rhythm and conduction | Normal sinus rhythm, no significant ST/T changes |
| Stress ECG | Exercise capacity, ischemic response | No ST depression >1mm, normal BP response |
| Echocardiogram | Cardiac structure and function | EF >50%, normal chamber sizes, normal valve function |
| Cardiac CT/Calcium Score | Coronary calcification | Score <100 Agatston units |
| Cardiac MRI | Tissue characterization, function | Normal structure, function, no scarring |
| Cardiac Catheterization | Definitive coronary anatomy | No stenosis >50% |
| BNP/NT-proBNP | Heart failure marker | BNP <100 pg/mL, NT-proBNP <300 pg/mL |
| Troponin | Myocardial damage marker | Below upper reference limit |

## Cardiovascular Risk Factors

The presence of multiple risk factors may increase ratings:

| Risk Factor | Low Risk | Moderate Risk | High Risk |
|-------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Blood Pressure | <130/80 | 130-159/80-99 | â‰¥160/100 |
| Total Cholesterol | <200 mg/dL | 200-240 mg/dL | >240 mg/dL |
| LDL Cholesterol | <100 mg/dL | 100-160 mg/dL | >160 mg/dL |
| HDL Cholesterol | >60 mg/dL | 40-60 mg/dL | <40 mg/dL |
| Triglycerides | <150 mg/dL | 150-200 mg/dL | >200 mg/dL |
| Diabetes | None | Well-controlled | Poorly controlled |
| Smoking | Never | Former >3 years | Current or <3 years |
| Family History | None | One relative >60 | Multiple or <60 |
| Obesity | BMI <25 | BMI 25-30 | BMI >30 |
| Exercise | Regular | Occasional | Sedentary |

## Common Cardiovascular Medications

| Medication Class | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Beta Blockers | Metoprolol, Atenolol, Carvedilol | Hypertension, CAD, HF, arrhythmia |
| ACE Inhibitors | Lisinopril, Enalapril, Ramipril | Hypertension, HF, CAD, kidney protection |
| ARBs | Losartan, Valsartan, Irbesartan | Hypertension, HF, alternative to ACE |
| Calcium Channel Blockers | Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Verapamil | Hypertension, angina, arrhythmia |
| Statins | Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin | Hyperlipidemia, CAD prevention |
| Antiplatelets | Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor | CAD, post-stent, stroke prevention |
| Anticoagulants | Warfarin, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban | Atrial fibrillation, DVT/PE, mechanical valves |
| Diuretics | Furosemide, HCTZ, Spironolactone | Hypertension, HF, edema |
| Antiarrhythmics | Amiodarone, Sotalol, Flecainide | Various arrhythmias |
| Nitrates | Isosorbide, Nitroglycerin | Angina, HF |

## Cardiac Procedures and Recovery Periods

| Procedure | Minimum Postpone Period | Post-Procedure Considerations |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Diagnostic Catheterization | 1 month | Results more important than procedure |
| Coronary Angioplasty/Stent | 3 months | Dual antiplatelet compliance, residual disease |
| CABG | 6 months | Graft type, completeness of revascularization |
| Valve Repair/Replacement | 6 months | Type of valve, anticoagulation needs |
| Pacemaker Implantation | 3 months | Underlying condition, dependency |
| ICD Implantation | 6 months | Underlying condition, shock history |
| Ablation Procedures | 3 months | Success rate, recurrence risk |
| Heart Transplantation | 12 months | Rejection risk, immunosuppression |

## Special Cardiovascular Considerations

1. **Women**: Different presentation of CAD, higher stroke risk
2. **Elderly**: Age-adjusted expectations for some parameters
3. **Athletes**: Physiologic adaptations vs. pathologic findings
4. **Congenital Heart Disease**: Specialized assessment based on defect type
5. **Post-COVID**: Emerging data on cardiovascular sequelae
