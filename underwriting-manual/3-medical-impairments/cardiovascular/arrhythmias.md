# Arrhythmias

## Definition & Classification

**Arrhythmia**: An abnormality in the rate, rhythm, or conduction of the heartbeat. Arrhythmias can originate in the atria (supraventricular) or ventricles (ventricular).

### Classification Systems

**By Origin**:
- Supraventricular arrhythmias: Originate above the ventricles
- Ventricular arrhythmias: Originate in the ventricles

**By Rate**:
- Bradyarrhythmias: Abnormally slow heart rate (<60 bpm)
- Tachyarrhythmias: Abnormally fast heart rate (>100 bpm)

**By Clinical Significance**:
- Benign: Minimal impact on cardiac function or mortality
- Potentially significant: May progress or indicate underlying disease
- Malignant: Associated with sudden cardiac death risk

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Medical history** including:
   - Date of diagnosis
   - Frequency and duration of episodes
   - Associated symptoms
   - Treatment history
   - Medication list

2. **Diagnostic test results**:
   - ECG (most recent)
   - Holter/event monitor reports
   - Echocardiogram (for structural assessment)
   - Electrophysiology study results (if performed)

3. **Follow-up information**:
   - Cardiologist notes
   - Response to treatment
   - Stability of condition

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Exercise stress test
- Cardiac MRI
- Electrophysiology study
- Genetic testing (for inherited arrhythmias)
- Sleep study (if sleep apnea suspected)

| Non-sustained (<3 beats) | No | None required | 0 to +50 points |
| Non-sustained (3-10 beats) | No | None or medication | +50 to +100 points |
| Non-sustained (>10 beats) | No | None or medication | +100 to +150 points |
| Non-sustained (any) | Yes | Any | +150 to +200 points or higher based on underlying condition |

| Sustained | Yes | Any | +200 to +250 points or Decline |

### Conduction Disorders

| Second-degree Mobitz I | None | No | 0 to +50 points |
| Second-degree Mobitz II | None | No | +50 to +100 points |
| Second-degree Mobitz II | None | Yes | +50 to +100 points |

| Bifascicular block | None | No | +50 to +100 points |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Recent diagnosis (<3 months) of significant arrhythmia
2. Recent cardiac procedure (<3 months for ablation, <6 months for device implantation)
3. Unstable symptoms or changing medication regimen
4. Pending diagnostic evaluation or intervention
5. Recent syncope (<6 months) due to arrhythmia

### Decline

1. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation with:
   - Multiple episodes despite treatment
   - Ejection fraction <30%
   - NYHA Class III-IV heart failure

2. Inherited arrhythmia syndromes with:
   - Multiple syncope episodes
   - Family history of sudden cardiac death
   - Non-compliance with treatment

3. Atrial fibrillation with:
   - History of stroke while non-compliant with anticoagulation
   - Severe valvular heart disease
   - Decompensated heart failure

4. Any arrhythmia with:
   - Recurrent syncope despite treatment
   - Multiple ICD shocks within past year

## Medication Considerations

| Medication | Underwriting Significance |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Beta blockers | Standard treatment for many arrhythmias |
| Calcium channel blockers | Common for rate control in AF and SVT |
| Antiarrhythmics (Class I) | Higher risk, monitor for proarrhythmic effects |
| Antiarrhythmics (Class III) | Amiodarone requires liver/thyroid monitoring |
| Anticoagulants | Essential for stroke prevention in AF |
| Digoxin | Older agent, narrow therapeutic window |

## Comorbidity Factors

The following conditions may increase arrhythmia ratings:

| Comorbidity | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Coronary artery disease | +25 to +100 points depending on severity |
| Heart failure | +50 to +150 points depending on severity |
| Valvular heart disease | +25 to +100 points depending on severity |
| Hypertension (uncontrolled) | +25 to +50 points |
| Obstructive sleep apnea | +25 to +75 points if untreated |
| Thyroid disease | +25 points if uncontrolled |
| Electrolyte abnormalities | +25 points if recurrent |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Successful interventions**:
   - Ablation with no recurrence >1 year
   - Stable pacemaker function >6 months
   - ICD with no discharges >2 years

2. **Medication stability**:
   - Stable regimen >1 year
   - No side effects or complications
   - Documented compliance

3. **Risk factor modification**:
   - Weight loss if obesity was contributor
   - Sleep apnea treatment if applicable
   - Alcohol reduction if alcohol-triggered

4. **Time stability**:
   - Longer duration since diagnosis/event
   - Decreasing frequency of episodes
   - Resolution of symptoms
