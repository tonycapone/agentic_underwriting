# Advanced Cardiac Arrhythmias

This section provides detailed underwriting guidance for complex cardiac arrhythmias beyond atrial fibrillation. These conditions range from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment for appropriate risk classification.

## Ventricular Arrhythmias

### Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)

**Definition**: Early beats originating from the ventricles, disrupting the normal heart rhythm.

#### Classification

| Occasional (<1,000/day) | None | None/minimal | Benign |
| Frequent (1,000-10,000/day) | None | None/minimal | Potentially significant |
| Very frequent (>10,000/day) | None | None/minimal | Potentially significant |
| Any frequency | Present | Any | Potentially significant to malignant |

#### Required Evidence

1. **Minimum Documentation**:
   - 12-lead ECG
   - Holter monitor or event recorder results with PVC frequency
   - Echocardiogram to assess structural heart disease
   - Basic metabolic panel (rule out electrolyte abnormalities)
