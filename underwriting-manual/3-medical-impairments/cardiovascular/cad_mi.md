# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) & Myocardial Infarction (MI)

## Definition & Classification

**Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: A condition characterized by narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, usually caused by atherosclerosis, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

**Myocardial Infarction (MI)**: Death of heart muscle tissue due to prolonged lack of blood supply, commonly known as a heart attack.

### Classification Systems

**CAD Severity by Angiography**:
- Mild: <50% stenosis in any coronary artery
- Moderate: 50-70% stenosis in one or more vessels
- Severe: >70% stenosis in one or more vessels or >50% in left main

**MI Classification**:
- STEMI: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
- NSTEMI: Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
- Type 1: Spontaneous MI related to atherosclerotic plaque
- Type 2: MI secondary to oxygen supply/demand imbalance
- Types 3-5: Procedural or other special circumstances

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Medical history** including:
   - Date of diagnosis/event
   - Treatment history
   - Interventions (stents, CABG)
   - Current symptoms
   - Medication list

2. **Diagnostic test results**:
   - ECG (most recent)
   - Cardiac enzyme results (for MI)
   - Cardiac catheterization report
   - Stress test results
   - Echocardiogram (for ejection fraction)
   - Lipid profile

3. **Follow-up information**:
   - Cardiologist notes
   - Evidence of risk factor control
   - Compliance with treatment

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Nuclear perfusion imaging
- Cardiac CT/calcium score
- Cardiac MRI
- BNP/NT-proBNP levels
- Exercise capacity documentation

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Any MI or revascularization procedure within:
   - 6 months for CABG or complex cases
   - 3 months for uncomplicated PCI/stent

2. Unstable angina or active symptoms

3. Pending cardiac investigations or interventions

4. Recent change in cardiac medications (<3 months)

### Decline

1. Ejection fraction <30%

2. Severe CAD with:
   - Refractory symptoms despite maximal therapy
   - Inoperable disease with poor prognosis
   - Recurrent hospitalizations for cardiac events

3. Multiple MIs with:
   - Incomplete revascularization
   - Ongoing symptoms
   - Poor functional capacity

4. Significant comorbidities:
   - Severe valvular disease
   - Advanced heart failure
   - Significant arrhythmias
   - End-stage renal disease

5. Non-compliance with critical cardiac medications

## Medication Considerations

| Medication | Underwriting Significance |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Aspirin | Standard preventive therapy |
| Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) | Recent stent or acute coronary syndrome |
| Statins | Standard therapy; high-intensity may indicate severe disease |
| Beta blockers | Standard post-MI; may indicate heart failure or arrhythmia |
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | Standard post-MI; may indicate heart failure |
| Nitrates | May indicate ongoing angina |
| Ranolazine | Typically for refractory angina |
| Anticoagulants | May indicate comorbid conditions (AF, LV thrombus) |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | May indicate severe hyperlipidemia or statin intolerance |

## Comorbidity Factors

The following conditions may increase CAD/MI ratings:

| Comorbidity | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Diabetes | +25 to +100 points depending on control |
| Hypertension (uncontrolled) | +25 to +50 points |
| Chronic kidney disease | +50 to +150 points depending on stage |
| Peripheral arterial disease | +25 to +75 points |
| Cerebrovascular disease | +25 to +75 points |
| Current smoking | +50 points minimum |
| Heart failure | +50 to +200 points depending on severity |
| Significant arrhythmia | +25 to +100 points |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Optimal risk factor control**:
   - BP consistently <130/80
   - LDL <70 mg/dL
   - Non-smoking >12 months
   - HbA1c <7% if diabetic
   - BMI <30

2. **Favorable testing**:
   - Negative stress test
   - Improved ejection fraction
   - Regression of disease on follow-up studies

3. **Lifestyle modifications**:
   - Regular exercise program
   - Cardiac rehabilitation completion
   - Mediterranean or DASH diet adherence
   - Weight loss if previously overweight/obese

4. **Time stability**:
   - Longer duration since event
   - No hospitalizations
   - Stable medication regimen
