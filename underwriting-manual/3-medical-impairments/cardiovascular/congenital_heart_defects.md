# Congenital Heart Defects

This section provides comprehensive underwriting guidelines for congenital heart defects (CHDs). With advances in diagnosis and treatment, many individuals with CHDs now reach adulthood and seek life insurance. Risk assessment requires understanding the specific defect, repair status, residual issues, and long-term complications.

## Overview and Classification

**Congenital Heart Defect**: A structural abnormality of the heart or great vessels present at birth.

### Classification by Hemodynamics

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Left-to-Right Shunts | Blood flows from left to right heart | ASD, VSD, PDA, AVSD |
| Right-to-Left Shunts | Blood flows from right to left heart | TOF, Eisenmenger syndrome |
| Obstructive Lesions | Blood flow is restricted | AS, PS, COA |
| Complex Defects | Multiple abnormalities | TGA, Single ventricle, HLHS |

### Classification by Severity

| Category | Characteristics | Examples |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Simple | Isolated, often not requiring intervention or simple repair | Small ASD, small VSD, mild PS |
| Moderate | May require intervention, good long-term outcomes | Large ASD, moderate VSD, COA |
| Severe | Complex, may require multiple surgeries, residual issues common | TOF, TGA, HLHS, single ventricle |

### Distribution of Adult CHD Patients

| Defect | Approximate Percentage |
|--------|----------------------|
| Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) | 25-30% |
| Atrial septal defect (ASD) | 10-15% |
| Ventricular septal defect (VSD) | 10-15% |
| Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) | 5-10% |
| Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) | 5-10% |
| Coarctation of aorta (COA) | 5-10% |
| Transposition complexes | 5% |
| Single ventricle/Fontan | 2-5% |
| Others | 10-15% |
