# Valve Disease

## Definition & Classification

**Valvular Heart Disease**: Disorders affecting the heart valves (mitral, aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonary), which can involve stenosis (narrowing), regurgitation (leakage), or both. Valvular disease can be congenital or acquired.

### Classification Systems

**By Affected Valve**:
- Mitral valve disease
- Aortic valve disease
- Tricuspid valve disease
- Pulmonary valve disease

**By Pathology**:
- Stenosis: Narrowing of the valve opening
- Regurgitation/Insufficiency: Backward leakage of blood
- Mixed: Combination of stenosis and regurgitation

**By Severity**:
- Mild
- Moderate
- Severe

**By Etiology**:
- Degenerative/age-related
- Rheumatic
- Congenital
- Infective endocarditis
- Secondary to other cardiac conditions

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Medical history** including:
   - Date of diagnosis
   - Etiology if known
   - Symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope)
   - Treatment history including interventions
   - Current medications

2. **Diagnostic test results**:
   - Echocardiogram with detailed valve assessment
   - Cardiac catheterization (if performed)
   - ECG
   - Chest X-ray (if available)

3. **Follow-up information**:
   - Cardiologist notes
   - Frequency of monitoring
   - Progression over time

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)
- Exercise stress test
- Cardiac MRI

- For post-surgical cases with multiple valve replacements, add +50 points to the single valve replacement rating

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

2. Pending valve surgery or intervention
3. Recent change in symptoms or treatment regimen (<3 months)
4. Active infective endocarditis
5. Decompensated heart failure due to valve disease

### Decline

1. Severe symptomatic valve disease without surgical intervention
2. Severe valve disease with:
   - NYHA Class III-IV heart failure
   - Ejection fraction <30%
   - Recurrent heart failure hospitalizations
3. Multiple mechanical valve replacements with anticoagulation complications
4. Valve disease with pulmonary hypertension (PASP >60 mmHg)
5. History of prosthetic valve thrombosis or recurrent endocarditis

## Medication Considerations

| Medication | Underwriting Significance |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Anticoagulants (warfarin) | Standard for mechanical valves; monitor INR compliance |
| Direct oral anticoagulants | Not approved for mechanical valves; may indicate non-compliance |
| Beta blockers | Common for symptom management |
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | May indicate heart failure or hypertension |
| Diuretics | May indicate heart failure or volume overload |
| Antibiotics | Prophylaxis for dental/surgical procedures |

## Comorbidity Factors

The following conditions may increase valve disease ratings:

| Comorbidity | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Atrial fibrillation | +25 to +75 points |
| Coronary artery disease | +50 to +100 points |
| Heart failure | +50 to +150 points depending on severity |
| Pulmonary hypertension | +50 to +150 points depending on severity |
| History of endocarditis | +50 to +100 points |
| History of thromboembolism | +50 to +100 points |
| Anticoagulation complications | +50 to +100 points |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Successful intervention**:
   - Valve repair/replacement with good result
   - Stable post-procedure course >2 years
   - Normal ventricular function

2. **Stability**:
   - No progression of valve disease over 3+ years
   - Stable mild to moderate disease without symptoms
   - Regular cardiology follow-up

3. **Excellent compliance**:
   - Consistent anticoagulation control (if applicable)
   - Regular echocardiographic monitoring
   - Adherence to endocarditis prophylaxis

## Special Considerations

### Prosthetic Valves

| Valve Type | Considerations | Rating Impact |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Mechanical | Requires lifelong anticoagulation | Higher rating than tissue valves |
| Bioprosthetic | Limited durability (10-15 years) | Lower initial rating but may increase with valve age |
| Transcatheter (TAVR) | Less invasive but less long-term data | Similar to surgical valves after initial recovery |

### Bicuspid Aortic Valve

|----------|--------|
| Incidental finding, no stenosis/regurgitation | 0 to +50 points |
| With mild dysfunction | +50 to +100 points |
| With aortic dilation | Additional +25 to +75 points |
| Post-repair/replacement | As per aortic valve guidelines |

### Mitral Valve Prolapse

| With moderate to severe regurgitation | Rate as per mitral regurgitation guidelines |
| With history of arrhythmias | Additional +25 to +50 points |
| With history of embolic events | Additional +50 to +100 points |

### Rheumatic Heart Disease

|----------|--------|
