# Congenital Defects

## Definition & Classification

**Congenital Defects**: Structural or functional abnormalities present at birth that can affect almost any part of the body. These abnormalities may be caused by genetic factors, environmental influences, or a combination of both. Congenital defects may range from mild to severe and can affect lifespan and quality of life to varying degrees.

### Classification Systems

**By Body System**:
- **Cardiovascular**: Septal defects, valve abnormalities, complex heart defects
- **Respiratory**: Tracheoesophageal fistula, lung hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia
- **Gastrointestinal**: Cleft lip/palate, esophageal atresia, intestinal malrotation
- **Genitourinary**: Hypospadias, cryptorchidism, renal agenesis
- **Musculoskeletal**: Clubfoot, polydactyly, skeletal dysplasias
- **Neurological**: Neural tube defects, hydrocephalus, microcephaly
- **Chromosomal**: Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome

**By Severity**:
- **Mild**: Minimal functional impact, may not require treatment
- **Moderate**: Requires treatment but generally good outcomes
- **Severe**: Significant functional impact, may require multiple interventions
- **Critical**: Life-threatening, requires immediate intervention

**By Etiology**:
- **Genetic**: Single gene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities
- **Environmental**: Teratogens, maternal conditions
- **Multifactorial**: Combination of genetic and environmental factors
- **Unknown**: No identifiable cause
