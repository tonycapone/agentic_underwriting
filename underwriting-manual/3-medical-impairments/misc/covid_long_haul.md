# COVID-19 Long-Haul Syndrome

## Definition & Classification

**COVID-19 Long-Haul Syndrome** (also known as Long COVID, Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [PASC], or Post-COVID-19 Syndrome): A condition characterized by persistent symptoms or new symptoms that develop after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, typically lasting beyond 12 weeks from the initial infection and not explained by an alternative diagnosis.

### Classification Systems

**World Health Organization (WHO) Definition**:
- Occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
- Usually within 3 months from the onset of COVID-19
- Symptoms last for at least 2 months
- Cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis

**Clinical Presentation Categories**:
- **Respiratory**: Shortness of breath, cough, reduced exercise capacity
- **Cardiovascular**: Chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
- **Neurological**: Headache, cognitive dysfunction ("brain fog"), sleep disturbances, peripheral neuropathy
- **Gastrointestinal**: Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, reduced appetite
- **Musculoskeletal**: Joint pain, muscle pain, weakness
- **Psychological**: Anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
- **General**: Fatigue, fever, post-exertional malaise
- **Other**: Loss of taste/smell, skin rashes, menstrual changes, tinnitus

**Severity Classification**:
- **Mild**: Symptoms do not significantly interfere with daily activities
- **Moderate**: Symptoms interfere with some daily activities
- **Severe**: Symptoms significantly limit daily activities and may require assistance
- **Very Severe**: Symptoms prevent most daily activities and may cause disability

**Temporal Classification**:
- **Subacute COVID-19**: Symptoms lasting 4-12 weeks after acute infection
- **Chronic or Long COVID-19**: Symptoms lasting >12 weeks after acute infection

| **Antidepressants** | SSRIs, SNRIs | May be used for mood disorders or neuropathic pain; assess underlying indication |
| **Gabapentinoids** | Gabapentin, Pregabalin | Typically for neuropathic pain; assess severity and impact |
| **Stimulants** | Modafinil, Methylphenidate | May be used for fatigue or cognitive issues; assess underlying severity |
| **Immunomodulators** | Various | Experimental use suggests more severe or refractory disease |

### Long COVID with ME/CFS-Like Presentation

For cases with:
- Post-exertional malaise
- Unrefreshing sleep
- Cognitive dysfunction
- Orthostatic intolerance

Consider rating similar to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome guidelines, typically:
- Mild: Table 2-3
- Moderate: Table 3-5
- Severe: Table 5-7 or higher

### Emerging Treatments and Clinical Trials

Participation in clinical trials or use of experimental treatments should be evaluated based on:
1. Underlying severity of Long COVID
2. Type of treatment
3. Response to treatment
4. Side effect profile

Individual consideration required, with potential postponement until treatment outcome is clear.
