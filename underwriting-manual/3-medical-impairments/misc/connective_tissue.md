# Connective Tissue Disorders

## Definition & Classification

**Connective Tissue Disorders**: A group of diseases that affect the tissues that support, bind, or separate other tissues and organs, characterized by abnormalities of the collagen, elastin, or other components of the extracellular matrix. These disorders can be inherited or acquired and often involve autoimmune mechanisms.

### Classification Systems

**Major Categories**:

1. **Heritable Connective Tissue Disorders**:
   - **Marfan Syndrome**: Autosomal dominant disorder affecting fibrillin-1
   - **Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS)**: Group of disorders affecting collagen structure and function
   - **Osteogenesis Imperfecta**: Group of disorders affecting type I collagen
   - **Loeys-Dietz Syndrome**: Autosomal dominant disorder affecting TGF-β signaling
   - **Stickler Syndrome**: Hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy

2. **Autoimmune Connective Tissue Disorders**:
   - **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: Multi-system autoimmune disease
   - **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)**: Inflammatory arthritis with systemic manifestations
   - **Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma)**: Characterized by fibrosis of skin and internal organs
   - **Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis**: Inflammatory myopathies
   - **Sjögren's Syndrome**: Characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth
   - **Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD)**: Overlap features of multiple disorders

3. **Other Related Disorders**:
   - **Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD)**: Features of autoimmune CTDs without fulfilling criteria for a specific diagnosis
   - **Overlap Syndromes**: Features of two or more defined autoimmune CTDs
   - **Relapsing Polychondritis**: Recurrent inflammation of cartilaginous structures

**Severity Classification**:
- **Mild**: Minimal organ involvement, good functional status, minimal treatment required
- **Moderate**: Some organ involvement, moderate functional limitations, requires regular treatment
- **Severe**: Significant organ involvement, major functional limitations, requires intensive treatment
