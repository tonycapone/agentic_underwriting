# Substance Use Disorders

## Definition & Classification

**Substance Use Disorder (SUD)**: A pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, manifested by symptoms such as taking larger amounts than intended, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use, continued use despite consequences, and development of tolerance or withdrawal.

### Classification Systems

**DSM-5 Substance Use Disorders**:
- Classified by specific substance (alcohol, cannabis, opioids, stimulants, etc.)
- Severity based on number of criteria met: Mild (2-3), Moderate (4-5), Severe (6+ criteria)

**Substance Categories with Underwriting Significance**:
- **Alcohol Use Disorder**: Pattern of problematic alcohol consumption
- **Opioid Use Disorder**: Problematic use of prescription or illicit opioids
- **Stimulant Use Disorder**: Problematic use of cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine
- **Cannabis Use Disorder**: Problematic use of marijuana/cannabis products
- **Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder**: Problematic use of benzodiazepines or similar substances
- **Polysubstance Use**: Problematic use of multiple substances concurrently

**Recovery Status**:
- **Early Remission**: 3-12 months without meeting criteria (except craving)
- **Sustained Remission**: 12+ months without meeting criteria (except craving)
- **On Maintenance Therapy**: Controlled use of medication to prevent relapse (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine)
- **In Controlled Environment**: Restricted access to substances (e.g., residential facility)
