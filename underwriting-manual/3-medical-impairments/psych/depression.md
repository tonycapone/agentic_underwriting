# Depression

## Definition & Classification

**Depression**: A common but serious mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, and a range of associated emotional and physical problems that can decrease a person's ability to function at work and home.

### Classification Systems

- **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: Depression as a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition

**Severity Classification**:
- **Mild**: Few symptoms beyond minimum criteria, minor functional impairment
- **Moderate**: Symptoms or functional impairment between mild and severe
- **Severe**: Several symptoms in excess of criteria, marked interference with functioning
- **With Psychotic Features**: Presence of delusions and/or hallucinations

**Course Specifiers**:
- **Single Episode**: First occurrence of depression
- **Recurrent**: Two or more episodes separated by at least 2 months
- **In Partial Remission**: Symptoms present but full criteria not met
