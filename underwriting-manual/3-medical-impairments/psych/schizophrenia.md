# Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

## Overview

Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are serious mental illnesses characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. These conditions typically emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood and can significantly impact life expectancy due to both direct effects of the illness and associated health behaviors. With appropriate treatment and support, however, many individuals can achieve periods of stability and improved functioning.

## Classification & Types

### Major Psychotic Disorders

| Disorder | Key Features | Prevalence | Typical Onset |
|----------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Schizophrenia** | Hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, negative symptoms, lasting >6 months | 0.5-1% | Late teens to early 30s |
| **Schizoaffective Disorder** | Features of schizophrenia plus major mood episode (depressive or bipolar type) | 0.3-0.5% | Late teens to early 30s |
| **Delusional Disorder** | Non-bizarre delusions without other schizophrenia symptoms, functioning not markedly impaired | 0.2% | Middle to late adulthood |
| **Brief Psychotic Disorder** | Sudden onset, duration 1 day to 1 month, full return to premorbid functioning | <0.1% | Any age, often stress-related |
| **Schizophreniform Disorder** | Same as schizophrenia but duration 1-6 months | 0.2% | Similar to schizophrenia |
| **Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder** | Direct physiological effects of substance/medication | Variable | Any age |
| **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition** | Direct physiological result of medical condition | Variable | Related to underlying condition |

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Functional Impact | Treatment Response |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | Few symptoms beyond minimum diagnostic criteria, minor functional impairment | Limited impact on daily living | Often responsive to treatment |
| **Moderate** | Intermediate between mild and severe | Notable impact on social, occupational functioning | Variable response to treatment |
| **Severe** | Multiple symptoms beyond diagnostic threshold, marked functional impairment | Major impairment in multiple areas | Often requires intensive treatment |
| **In Remission** | No significant active symptoms | Functionality improved or restored | Maintained on treatment |

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Key Considerations for Psychotic Disorders

1. **Specific diagnosis and severity**
2. **Duration of illness and stability**
3. **Treatment compliance and response**
4. **History of hospitalizations**
5. **Suicide risk/history**
6. **Substance use**
7. **Functional capacity (employment, independence)**
8. **Social support system**
9. **Physical health status**

### Common Co-occurring Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence | Impact on Underwriting |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| Substance use disorders | 40-50% | Significant factor in mortality risk |
| Depression | 25-60% | Increases suicide risk |
| Anxiety disorders | 30-40% | May affect treatment compliance |
| Metabolic syndrome | 30-40% | Significant factor in mortality risk |
| Cardiovascular disease | 2-3x general population | Major mortality factor |
| Type 2 diabetes | 2-4x general population | Major mortality factor |

## Final Assessment Approach

1. **Verify diagnosis specificity**:
   - Confirmed diagnosis by psychiatric specialist
   - Differentiate between schizophrenia spectrum disorders
   - Rule out substance-induced or medical causes

2. **Evaluate illness course**:
   - Age at onset and duration
   - Pattern of hospitalizations
   - Treatment response over time
   - Frequency and severity of relapses

3. **Assess current stability**:
   - Duration of current stability
   - Medication regimen and adherence
   - Presence of residual symptoms
   - Recent psychiatric evaluation

4. **Review functional capacity**:
   - Independent living status
   - Employment history and status
   - Social functioning
   - Activities of daily living

5. **Consider mortality risk factors**:
   - Suicide risk
   - Substance use history
   - Physical health comorbidities
   - Social support system
