# Bipolar Disorders

## Definition & Classification

**Bipolar Disorder**: A group of mental health conditions characterized by episodic changes in mood, energy, activity levels, and concentration, with alternating periods of elevated mood (mania/hypomania) and depression. These mood episodes cause significant disturbance in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Bipolar disorders involve extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).

### Classification Systems

**DSM-5 Bipolar Disorders**:
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Characterized by at least one manic episode, which may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes
- **Bipolar II Disorder**: Pattern of hypomanic and major depressive episodes, without full manic episodes
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance with numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms for at least 2 years
- **Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder**: Symptoms due to substance use, medication, or toxin exposure
- **Bipolar Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: Direct physiological consequence of another medical condition
- **Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorders**: Bipolar features that don't meet criteria for other bipolar disorders

**Episode Classifications**:
- **Manic Episode**: Abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased activity/energy for ≥1 week
- **Hypomanic Episode**: Similar to mania but less severe, lasting ≥4 days, without marked impairment
- **Major Depressive Episode**: Depressed mood or loss of interest for ≥2 weeks with associated symptoms
- **Mixed Features**: Simultaneous presence of manic/hypomanic and depressive symptoms

**Course Specifiers**:
- **Rapid Cycling**: Four or more mood episodes in a 12-month period
- **With Seasonal Pattern**: Regular temporal relationship between mood episodes and time of year
- **With Psychotic Features**: Presence of delusions or hallucinations
- **With Anxious Distress**: Presence of anxiety symptoms during mood episodes
- **With Peripartum Onset**: Onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum
- **In Partial/Full Remission**: Symptoms partially or fully absent

## Medication Considerations

| Medication Category | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Lithium** | Lithium carbonate, Lithium citrate | Gold standard for bipolar; indicates well-established diagnosis |
| **Anticonvulsant Mood Stabilizers** | Valproate (Depakote), Lamotrigine (Lamictal), Carbamazepine (Tegretol) | Common first-line treatments; specific ones may target different phases |
| **Atypical Antipsychotics** | Quetiapine (Seroquel), Olanzapine (Zyprexa), Aripiprazole (Abilify), Risperidone (Risperdal) | May indicate acute mania, psychotic features, or treatment-resistant cases |
| **Antidepressants** | SSRIs, SNRIs, Bupropion | When used alone, risk of triggering mania; usually used with mood stabilizers |
| **Benzodiazepines** | Lorazepam (Ativan), Clonazepam (Klonopin) | Often used short-term for acute symptoms; long-term use may indicate more complex case |
| **Multiple Mood Stabilizers** | Combination therapy | Indicates more difficult-to-treat bipolar disorder |
| **Injectable Antipsychotics** | Long-acting risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole | May indicate history of non-compliance or severe disease |
