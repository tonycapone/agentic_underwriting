### Classification Systems

**DSM-5 Anxiety Disorders**:
- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: Excessive anxiety and worry about various events or activities, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months
- **Panic Disorder**: Recurrent unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having additional attacks
- **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)**: Marked fear or anxiety about social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others

- **Separation Anxiety Disorder**: Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from attachment figures

**Related Disorders**:
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**: Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both
- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to traumatic event(s)
- **Acute Stress Disorder**: Similar to PTSD but occurring within 1 month of trauma exposure

**Severity Classification**:
- **Mild**: Minimal symptoms beyond diagnostic threshold, minor functional impairment
- **Moderate**: Intermediate between mild and severe
- **Severe**: Multiple symptoms in excess of diagnostic criteria, marked functional impairment
