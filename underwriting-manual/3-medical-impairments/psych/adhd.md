# Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

## Overview

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. ADHD typically begins in childhood but often continues into adolescence and adulthood. When properly managed, ADHD generally has minimal impact on mortality risk.

## Classification & Types

### DSM-5 Presentation Specifiers

| Presentation | Key Features | Prevalence |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Predominantly Inattentive** | Difficulty sustaining attention, following instructions, organizing tasks; easily distracted | ~30% of cases |
| **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive** | Fidgeting, excessive talking, difficulty waiting turn, interrupting others | ~10% of cases |
| **Combined Presentation** | Symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity | ~60% of cases |

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Functional Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | Few symptoms beyond required threshold; minimal functional impairment | Limited impact on daily functioning |
| **Moderate** | Symptoms or functional impairment between mild and severe | Notable impact on social, academic, or occupational functioning |
| **Severe** | Many symptoms beyond required threshold; significant functional impairment | Substantial impairment in multiple settings |

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Key Considerations for ADHD

1. **Symptom control with or without medication**
2. **Presence and severity of co-occurring conditions**
3. **Treatment adherence and response**
4. **Academic/occupational functioning**
5. **Driving history and risk-taking behaviors**
6. **Substance use history**
7. **Stability in personal and professional life**

### Common Co-occurring Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence in ADHD | Impact on Underwriting |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Learning disorders | 25-40% | Minimal impact if well-managed |
| Anxiety disorders | 30-40% | Rate per anxiety guidelines |
| Depression | 20-30% | Rate per depression guidelines |
| Oppositional defiant disorder | 40-60% (children) | Consider behavior pattern history |
| Conduct disorder | 20-40% (children) | Consider behavior pattern/legal history |
| Substance use disorders | 15-25% (adults) | Rate per substance use guidelines |
| Sleep disorders | 25-50% | Consider impact on overall health |
| Bipolar disorder | 10-20% | Rate per bipolar disorder guidelines |

## Medication Considerations

### Common ADHD Medications

| Medication Class | Examples | Underwriting Considerations |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| **Stimulants** | Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), Amphetamine derivatives (Adderall, Vyvanse) | Generally no additional rating when used as prescribed |
| **Non-stimulants** | Atomoxetine (Strattera), Guanfacine (Intuniv), Clonidine (Kapvay) | Generally no additional rating when used as prescribed |
| **Antidepressants** (off-label) | Bupropion (Wellbutrin), Venlafaxine (Effexor) | Consider reason for selection over first-line treatments |
| **Multiple medications** | Various combinations | Consider complexity of condition and response to treatment |

### Medication Dosage

Standard therapeutic dosages generally do not warrant additional rating. However, very high doses may indicate:
- Severe symptomatology
- Medication resistance
- Possible misuse

In such cases, additional medical evidence may be required.

## Special Considerations

### Adult-Diagnosed ADHD

Factors to consider for individuals diagnosed as adults:
1. Reason for late diagnosis
2. Evidence of symptoms during childhood
3. Functional history prior to diagnosis
4. Response to treatment since diagnosis
5. Occupational stability

### ADHD and Driving Risk

| History | Underwriting Approach |
|---------|----------------------|
| Clean driving record | No additional rating |
| 1-2 minor violations | Standard underwriting approach |
| Multiple violations/at-fault accidents | Additional rating per motor vehicle record guidelines |
| DUI/reckless driving | Rate per motor vehicle record guidelines |

### ADHD and Substance Use

Individuals with ADHD have higher rates of substance use disorders. Consider:
1. Type and extent of substance use
2. Treatment history
3. Duration of sobriety
4. ADHD treatment adherence during sobriety

### Self-Medication Concerns

Untreated or undertreated ADHD may lead to self-medication with:
- Alcohol
- Cannabis
- Stimulants
- Other substances

Thorough substance use history is essential for comprehensive evaluation.
