# Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

## Overview

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that can develop after exposure to traumatic events such as combat, natural disasters, serious accidents, physical or sexual assault, or other life-threatening situations. PTSD is characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity. Approximately 6-8% of the U.S. population will experience PTSD at some point in their lives, with higher rates among veterans and survivors of interpersonal violence.

## Classification & Types

### DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria Categories

| Symptom Cluster | Key Features | Diagnostic Threshold |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Intrusion symptoms** | Recurrent memories, nightmares, flashbacks, psychological distress at reminders | ≥1 symptom |
| **Avoidance** | Avoidance of trauma-related thoughts, feelings, or external reminders | ≥1 symptom |
| **Negative alterations in cognition and mood** | Inability to recall aspects of trauma, persistent negative beliefs, distorted blame, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, inability to experience positive emotions | ≥2 symptoms |
| **Alterations in arousal and reactivity** | Irritable behavior, reckless behavior, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, concentration problems, sleep disturbance | ≥2 symptoms |

### PTSD Subtypes and Specifiers

| Subtype/Specifier | Description | Underwriting Implications |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Acute PTSD** | Duration of 1-3 months | Often resolves with treatment; better prognosis |
| **Chronic PTSD** | Duration >3 months | May require ongoing management; higher mortality risk |
| **Delayed-onset PTSD** | Full criteria not met until >6 months after trauma | Variable prognosis |
| **With dissociative symptoms** | Depersonalization or derealization | Higher severity; may require specialized treatment |
| **Combat-related PTSD** | Related to military service | Consider co-occurring conditions and veteran resources |
| **Complex PTSD*** | Result of prolonged, repeated trauma | Often more severe with additional symptoms |

*Complex PTSD is recognized in ICD-11 but not formally in DSM-5

### Trauma Source Classification

| Trauma Type | Examples | Underwriting Considerations |
|-------------|----------|----------------------------|
| **Interpersonal violence** | Sexual assault, domestic violence, physical assault | Often higher severity and chronicity |
| **Combat exposure** | Military combat, war zone exposure | Consider military service details and VA support |
| **Accident/disaster** | Motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters, fires | Often better prognosis with treatment |
| **Medical trauma** | Life-threatening illness, medical procedures | Consider underlying medical condition |
| **Childhood trauma** | Abuse, neglect, witnessing violence | Often complex presentation with developmental impacts |
| **Occupational trauma** | First responders, emergency personnel | Consider ongoing exposure risk |

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Key Considerations for PTSD

1. **Time since trauma exposure**
2. **Symptom severity and functional impact**
3. **Treatment response and compliance**
4. **Presence and control of comorbid conditions**
5. **Suicidal ideation or behavior history**
6. **Substance use patterns**
7. **Occupational stability**
8. **Sleep disturbance severity**
9. **Support systems**

### Common Co-occurring Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence in PTSD | Impact on Underwriting |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Major depressive disorder | 40-65% | Rate per depression guidelines; consider suicide risk |
| Substance use disorders | 40-60% | Rate per substance use guidelines; common self-medication |
| Anxiety disorders | 30-50% | May increase rating if poorly controlled |
| Traumatic brain injury | 15-30% (combat PTSD) | Rate per TBI guidelines |
| Sleep disorders | 70-90% | Consider impact on overall health |
| Chronic pain | 20-40% | Consider pain management approach |
| Suicidal ideation | 20-30% | Significant factor in risk assessment |
