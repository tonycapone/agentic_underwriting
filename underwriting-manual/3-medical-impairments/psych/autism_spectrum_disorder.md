# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

## Overview

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent challenges in social communication and interaction, alongside restricted and repetitive behavior patterns, interests, or activities. The spectrum encompasses a wide range of presentations, from individuals requiring substantial support to those who are highly functioning with minimal support needs.

## Classification & Severity Levels

### DSM-5 Severity Levels

| Severity Level | Description | Support Required |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Level 1** | "Requiring support" | Difficulty initiating social interactions and demonstrating atypical responses to social overtures; inflexibility causes significant interference with functioning |
| **Level 2** | "Requiring substantial support" | Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills; restricted/repetitive behaviors appear frequently enough to be obvious; distress/difficulty changing focus or action |
| **Level 3** | "Requiring very substantial support" | Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication; very limited initiation of social interactions; extreme difficulty coping with change, restricted/repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning |

### Functional Independence Classification

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Independent** | Lives and functions independently with minimal or no support | Manages own finances, employment, and daily living |
| **Semi-independent** | Requires some support for complex tasks | May need assistance with financial planning, complex healthcare decisions |
| **Supported** | Regular assistance needed for daily functioning | Requires regular support for daily activities, employment assistance |
| **Highly Dependent** | Continuous supervision and substantial support required | Needs 24-hour supervision, assistance with basic activities of daily living |

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Key Considerations for ASD

1. **Severity level and functional independence**
2. **Co-occurring conditions**
3. **Cognitive functioning**
4. **History of self-injurious behaviors**
5. **Stability of support system**
6. **Treatment adherence and response**
7. **Ability to communicate health needs**
8. **Employment status and stability**

### Common Co-occurring Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence in ASD | Impact on Underwriting |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Intellectual disability | 31-50% | Significant factor in rating decisions |
| ADHD | 30-60% | May increase risk if poorly controlled |
| Anxiety disorders | 40-60% | Consider severity and treatment response |
| Depression | 25-35% | Consider severity, treatment, suicidality |
| Epilepsy/seizure disorders | 20-30% | Rate per seizure disorder guidelines |
| Sleep disorders | 50-80% | Consider impact on overall health |
| Gastrointestinal disorders | 30-70% | Generally minimal impact on rating |
| Self-injurious behaviors | 25-30% | Significant factor in high-severity ASD |

4. **School/vocational performance documentation**
5. **Legal guardian/power of attorney documentation (if applicable)**

## Special Considerations

### Children and Adolescents with ASD

Life insurance applications for minors with ASD should consider:
1. Family history
2. Developmental trajectory
3. Response to early intervention
4. Educational accommodations and progress
5. Parental/guardian understanding of condition

### Asperger's Syndrome (Now Part of ASD Level 1)

Individuals previously diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (under DSM-IV) typically fall under Level 1 ASD in current classification. These individuals often:
- Have average or above-average intelligence
- Demonstrate strong verbal skills
- May excel in specialized academic or professional areas
- Often qualify for standard to Table 2 rates with stable history

### Adult-Diagnosed ASD

Factors to consider for individuals diagnosed as adults:
1. Reason for late diagnosis
2. Functional history prior to diagnosis
3. Life adaptation strategies developed
4. Employment history
5. Social support network

## Long-Term Considerations

| Factor | Underwriting Implication |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Consistent living situation | Positive prognostic indicator |
| Stable support system | Essential for maintained functioning |
| Treatment continuity | Indicates commitment to health maintenance |
| Financial planning accommodations | Indicates appropriate preparation for care needs |
| Guardian/trustee arrangements | Ensures continued support if primary caregivers unavailable |
