## Key Underwriting Considerations

1. **Diagnosis and severity**: Specific condition, severity, and diagnostic criteria
2. **Treatment history**: Types of treatment, response, compliance, and current treatment status
3. **Stability**: Duration of stability, frequency of episodes, and pattern of symptoms
4. **Functional impact**: Effect on occupational, social, and daily functioning
5. **Hospitalization history**: Frequency, duration, and recency of psychiatric hospitalizations
6. **Suicidality**: History of suicidal ideation, attempts, and current risk factors
7. **Comorbidities**: Co-occurring psychiatric and medical conditions
8. **Substance use**: Current or past substance use issues

## Evidence Requirements

- Psychiatrist/psychologist evaluations

- Hospital records for any psychiatric admissions
- Psychotherapy notes (when available)
- Functional assessment information
- Substance use history
- Employment history and stability

## General Approach

Psychiatric conditions are evaluated based on diagnosis, severity, treatment compliance, functional stability, and risk factors. Ratings range from standard for well-controlled conditions with good function and stability to significant ratings or decline for severe, unstable conditions with significant functional impairment, frequent hospitalizations, or high-risk features.
