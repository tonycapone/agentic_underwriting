# Bipolar Disorder

## Definition & Classification

**Bipolar Disorder**: A chronic mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood episodes cause significant disturbances in energy, activity, sleep, behavior, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.

### Classification Systems

**DSM-5 Bipolar and Related Disorders**:
- **Bipolar I Disorder**: Characterized by at least one manic episode, which may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes
- **Bipolar II Disorder**: Characterized by at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode, but no manic episodes
- **Cyclothymic Disorder**: Characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents)
- **Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar Disorder**: Bipolar symptoms induced by substances or medications
- **Bipolar Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: Bipolar symptoms as a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition
- **Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorders**: Bipolar symptoms that do not meet full criteria for the above disorders
- **Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorders**: Bipolar symptoms without enough information for specific diagnosis

**Episode Types**:
- **Manic Episode**: Abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased energy or activity for at least 1 week
- **Hypomanic Episode**: Similar to manic episode but less severe and lasting at least 4 days
- **Major Depressive Episode**: Depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure for at least 2 weeks
- **Mixed Features**: Simultaneous presence of manic/hypomanic and depressive symptoms

**Course Specifiers**:
- **With Rapid Cycling**: Four or more mood episodes in a 12-month period
- **With Seasonal Pattern**: Regular temporal relationship between onset of mood episodes and particular time of year
- **With Psychotic Features**: Presence of delusions or hallucinations
- **With Anxious Distress**: Presence of anxiety symptoms during mood episodes
- **With Peripartum Onset**: Onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum
