# Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

## Overview

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas, or sensations (obsessions) that drive individuals to perform repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions significantly interfere with daily activities and cause substantial distress. OCD affects approximately 2-3% of the population and typically begins in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood.

## Classification & Subtypes

### Common OCD Presentations

| Subtype | Obsessions | Compulsions | Prevalence |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Contamination** | Fears of germs, disease, bodily fluids | Excessive cleaning, handwashing, avoidance | 25-30% |
| **Checking** | Fears of harm, mistakes, accidents | Repeated checking of locks, appliances, safety | 20-25% |
| **Symmetry/Ordering** | Need for exactness, balance, order | Arranging, aligning, counting, sequencing | 15-20% |
| **Forbidden/Taboo Thoughts** | Violent, sexual, or religious intrusions | Mental rituals, reassurance seeking, avoidance | 10-15% |
| **Hoarding** | Distress at discarding possessions | Excessive acquisition, inability to discard items | 5-10% (now a separate disorder) |

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Y-BOCS Score | Description | Functional Impact |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | 8-15 | Obsessions and compulsions present but manageable | Limited interference with daily functioning |
| **Moderate** | 16-23 | Significant symptoms requiring regular management | Notable impact on social, occupational functioning |
| **Severe** | 24-31 | Prominent symptoms with substantial distress | Major impairment in multiple areas of functioning |
| **Extreme** | 32-40 | Incapacitating symptoms | Unable to function in daily life |

*Note: Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) is the standard clinical assessment tool for OCD severity.

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Key Considerations for OCD

1. **Symptom severity and functional impact**
2. **Treatment response and compliance**
3. **Presence and control of comorbid conditions**
4. **Suicidal ideation or behavior history**
5. **Occupational stability and social functioning**
6. **Insight level (recognition that obsessions/compulsions are excessive)**
7. **Duration of stability**

### Common Co-occurring Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence in OCD | Impact on Underwriting |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Major depressive disorder | 40-60% | Rate per depression guidelines |
| Anxiety disorders | 40-50% | May increase rating if poorly controlled |
| Tic disorders/Tourette's | 25-35% | Consider severity and control |
| Body dysmorphic disorder | 15-25% | Consider severity and suicidality risk |
| Eating disorders | 10-20% | Rate per eating disorder guidelines |
| Substance use disorders | 15-25% | Rate per substance use guidelines |
| Personality disorders | 20-30% | May increase rating based on type and severity |
| Autism spectrum disorder | 5-10% | Consider overall functional status |

| Sustained remission with minimal symptoms (>5 years) | -25 points |
| Regular ongoing psychotherapy | -25 points |
| Successful treatment with CBT alone | -25 points |
| Stable employment (>3 years) | -25 points |

| Significant functional impairment despite treatment | +25 to +50 points |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

| Scenario | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Recent diagnosis without established treatment (<6 months) | Postpone |
| Recent medication change (<3 months) | Postpone |
| Recent psychiatric hospitalization (<12 months) | Postpone or decline |
| Recent suicide attempt (<24 months) | Postpone or decline |
| Extreme OCD with minimal response to treatment | Decline |
| OCD with current, unstable, severe comorbidities | Postpone or decline |
| Current disability due to OCD | Individual consideration or decline |

## Medication Considerations

### Common OCD Medications

| Medication Class | Examples | Underwriting Considerations |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| **SSRIs** | Fluoxetine (Prozac), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Fluvoxamine (Luvox) | Generally no additional rating when used as prescribed; typically higher doses needed for OCD than depression |
| **SNRIs** | Venlafaxine (Effexor), Duloxetine (Cymbalta) | Generally no additional rating when used as prescribed |
| **Tricyclic Antidepressants** | Clomipramine (Anafranil) | Consider monitoring for cardiac effects at higher doses |
| **Atypical Antipsychotics** (adjunctive) | Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Quetiapine | Small doses as augmentation generally acceptable; larger doses may require additional consideration |
| **Benzodiazepines** | Clonazepam, Lorazepam | Consider dependency potential; typically not first-line for OCD |
| **Multiple medications** | Various combinations | Consider complexity of condition and treatment response |

### Treatment Approaches

| Treatment | Effectiveness | Underwriting Implication |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **CBT with ERP*** | First-line psychological treatment | Positive factor in risk assessment |
| **SSRI medication** | First-line pharmacological treatment | Standard treatment, generally no additional rating |
| **Combined CBT and medication** | Often most effective approach | Indicates appropriate treatment engagement |
| **Treatment-resistant approaches** | Augmentation strategies, experimental treatments | May indicate more severe, complex condition |
| **Neurosurgical approaches** (DBS, cingulotomy) | Last-resort for severe, treatment-resistant cases | Individual consideration, typically decline |

*ERP = Exposure and Response Prevention

## Special Considerations

### OCD vs. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD)

| Feature | OCD | OCPD | Underwriting Implication |
|---------|-----|------|--------------------------|
| **Insight** | Recognizes thoughts as excessive (except in poor insight cases) | Views traits as correct and desirable | Better prognosis with insight |
| **Distress** | Significant distress from unwanted thoughts | Limited distress about perfectionism | Higher distress may indicate more severe OCD |
| **Symptoms** | Specific obsessions and compulsions | Pervasive pattern of perfectionism and control | Different rating approaches |
| **Treatment response** | Responds to SSRIs and ERP | Personality traits more resistant to change | Better outcomes with OCD proper |

### OCD in Children and Adolescents

Considerations for juvenile life insurance:
1. Age of onset (typically begins by age 14)
2. Impact on development and education
3. Family accommodation of symptoms
4. Treatment engagement
5. Prognosis into adulthood

### OCD and Disability

| Disability Status | Underwriting Approach |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| History of short-term disability | Individual consideration based on current function |
| Current short-term disability | Postpone until return to work |
| History of long-term disability with return to work | Individual consideration based on stability |
| Current long-term disability | Decline |

### Specialized OCD Treatments

| Treatment | When Used | Underwriting Implication |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Intensive outpatient program** | Moderate-severe cases with inadequate response to standard care | Indicates more severe case but appropriate treatment |
| **Residential treatment** | Severe, treatment-resistant cases | Consider time since treatment and current function |
| **Transcranial magnetic stimulation** | Adjunctive treatment for resistant cases | Emerging approach, consider as positive treatment engagement |
| **Deep brain stimulation** | Severe, treatment-resistant cases | Individual consideration, typically decline |

## Final Assessment Approach

1. **Evaluate symptom control**:
   - Current severity and impact
   - Treatment response
   - Duration of stability

2. **Assess comorbidities**:
   - Type and severity
   - Treatment and control
   - Interaction with OCD symptoms

3. **Review functional status**:
   - Occupational functioning
   - Social relationships
   - Independent living skills

4. **Consider treatment profile**:
   - Appropriateness of treatment
   - Adherence history
   - Provider specialty and involvement

5. **Evaluate longitudinal course**:
   - Age of onset
   - Progression pattern
   - Periods of remission and relapse
