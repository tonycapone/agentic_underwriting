# Eating Disorders

This document provides detailed underwriting guidelines for evaluating life insurance applications from individuals with eating disorders.

## Overview

Eating disorders are serious mental health conditions characterized by persistent disturbances in eating behaviors and associated distressing thoughts and emotions. These disorders can significantly impact physical health and have among the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric illness. With appropriate treatment, however, recovery is possible, and many individuals can maintain long-term health after recovery. Primary eating disorders include Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED).

## Classification & Types

### Major Eating Disorders

| Disorder | Key Features | Mortality Risk | Prevalence |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| **Anorexia Nervosa** | Severe restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, disturbance in body perception | Highest (SMR* 5.9) | 0.5-1% lifetime |
| **Bulimia Nervosa** | Recurrent episodes of binge eating with compensatory behaviors (e.g., purging, excessive exercise), self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight | Elevated (SMR 1.9) | 1-2% lifetime |
| **Binge Eating Disorder** | Recurrent episodes of binge eating without compensatory behaviors, marked distress about binge eating | Elevated | 2-3% lifetime |
| **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED)** | Clinically significant symptoms but does not meet full criteria for specific disorders | Variable | 4-5% lifetime |
| **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)** | Eating disturbance due to sensory characteristics or consequences of eating, not related to body image concerns | Variable | More common in children |

*SMR = Standardized Mortality Ratio

### Anorexia Nervosa Types

| Subtype | Description | Additional Considerations |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Restricting Type** | Weight loss accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise | Higher risk of cardiac complications, osteoporosis |
| **Binge-Eating/Purging Type** | Regular engagement in binge eating or purging behaviors (self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics) | Higher risk of electrolyte disturbances, dental erosion |

### Severity Classification (Anorexia Nervosa)

| Severity | BMI (kg/m²) | Physical Symptoms | Functional Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | ≥17.0 | Minimal physical symptoms | Limited impairment |
| **Moderate** | 16.0-16.99 | Some physical symptoms | Moderate impairment |
| **Severe** | 15.0-15.99 | Significant physical symptoms | Substantial impairment |
| **Extreme** | <15.0 | Severe physical complications | Extreme functional impairment |

### Severity Classification (Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder)

| Severity | Binge/Purge Episodes (per week) | Physical Symptoms | Functional Impact |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mild** | 1-3 | Minimal physical symptoms | Limited impairment |
| **Moderate** | 4-7 | Some physical symptoms | Moderate impairment |
| **Severe** | 8-13 | Significant physical symptoms | Substantial impairment |
| **Extreme** | ≥14 | Severe physical complications | Extreme functional impairment |

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Eating Disorders in Males

Approximately 10-15% of eating disorder cases occur in males. Special considerations:
1. Often underdiagnosed
2. May present with more muscle dysmorphia components
3. Similar medical risks as females
4. Underwriting approach follows same guidelines

### Eating Disorders with Type 1 Diabetes ("Diabulimia")

Insulin omission as a weight control method carries significant risks:
- Higher rates of diabetic ketoacidosis
- Accelerated microvascular complications
- 3x increased mortality risk

Rate based on:
1. Current insulin adherence
2. History of DKA episodes
3. Presence of diabetes complications
4. Duration of both conditions

### Eating Disorders in Athletes

| Scenario | Underwriting Approach |
|----------|----------------------|
| **History of RED-S/Female Athlete Triad** | Consider bone health, menstrual history, energy availability |
| **Competitive athlete post-recovery** | Evaluate current exercise patterns, nutritional adequacy |
| **High-performance athlete** | Consider sport-specific requirements and body composition expectations |

### Pregnancy and Postpartum

| Scenario | Underwriting Approach |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Current pregnancy with ED history** | Generally postpone until postpartum |
| **Postpartum with ED history** | Individual consideration based on current symptoms |
| **ED relapse during/after pregnancy** | Postpone until stability achieved |

## Long-Term Recovery Markers

| Marker | Significance | Underwriting Implication |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Weight stability** | Core recovery indicator | Essential for improved rating |
| **Normalized eating patterns** | Behavioral recovery | Important for sustained improvement |
| **Regular menses (if applicable)** | Physiological recovery | Significant health indicator |
| **Normalized lab values** | Medical recovery | Indicates reduced medical risk |
| **Psychological flexibility around food/body** | Cognitive recovery | Reduces relapse risk |
| **Appropriate exercise relationship** | Behavioral recovery | Important for sustained recovery |

## Final Assessment Approach

   - Specific eating disorder type
   - Severity and course
   - Current status

2. **Evaluate physical health status**:
   - Current BMI/weight status
   - Medical complications (past and present)
   - Laboratory values
   - Vital signs

3. **Assess recovery status**:
   - Duration of recovery
   - Stability of recovery
   - Residual symptoms
   - Relapse history

4. **Review treatment history**:
   - Types of treatment received
   - Levels of care required
   - Current treatment engagement
   - Response to treatment

5. **Consider comorbidities**:
   - Psychiatric comorbidities
   - Medical comorbidities
   - Substance use history
   - Suicide risk history
