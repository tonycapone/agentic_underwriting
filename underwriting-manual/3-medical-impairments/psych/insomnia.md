# Insomnia

## Definition & Classification

**Insomnia Disorder**: Persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep, occurring despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and associated with daytime impairment. Distinguish transient/short-term insomnia from chronic insomnia (≥3 nights/week for ≥3 months).

### Classification Systems

- **DSM-5/DSM-5-TR Criteria**: Sleep difficulty, adequate opportunity, daytime impairment, occurring ≥3 nights/week for ≥3 months, not better explained by another sleep, medical, or mental disorder or substance.
- **ICSD-3 Categories**: Chronic insomnia disorder; short-term insomnia disorder; other insomnia disorders.
- **Phenotypes**:
  - Sleep-onset insomnia
  - Sleep-maintenance insomnia
  - Early-morning awakening
  - Paradoxical insomnia (sleep state misperception)

## Required Evidence

### Minimum Documentation

1. **Diagnostic confirmation**:
   - Clinician diagnosis and onset date
   - Pattern (onset vs. maintenance vs. early awakening)
   - Frequency (nights/week) and chronicity (months/years)
   - Daytime impairment (fatigue, concentration, mood, function)

2. **Contributors and differentials**:
   - Screening for sleep apnea, RLS/PLMD, circadian disorders, narcolepsy
   - Psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety, depression, PTSD, substance use)
   - Medical comorbidity (chronic pain, COPD/asthma, GERD, hyperthyroidism, menopause)
   - Medications/substances (stimulants, steroids, caffeine, alcohol)

3. **Treatment regimen**:
   - Non-pharmacologic: CBT-I, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene
   - Pharmacologic: agents, dose, frequency, PRN vs. nightly, duration of use
   - Response to treatment and adherence

4. **Functional status**:
   - Occupational performance and attendance
   - Driving drowsiness incidents or accidents
   - Activities of daily living impact

5. **Investigations**:
   - Sleep diary/actigraphy if available
   - Polysomnography only if performed (rule out OSA, PLMD, parasomnia)

### Additional Evidence for Complex Cases

- Sleep specialist consultation notes
- Documented exclusion of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) where suspected
- Psychiatric assessment if comorbid mood/anxiety disorders
- Documentation of medication taper attempts and outcomes

## Rating Guidelines

### Primary/Uncomplicated Insomnia

| Severity/Control | Treatment | Duration of Stability | Rating |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| Mild symptoms, minimal daytime impact | Sleep hygiene/CBT-I | ≥6 months | Standard |
| Mild-moderate, improved | CBT-I ± intermittent meds | ≥6 months | Standard to +25 points |
| Moderate, residual daytime symptoms | Any | <6 months stability | +25 to +50 points |
| Severe at presentation, now well-controlled | CBT-I ± meds | ≥12 months | 0 to +25 points |

**Modifying Factors**:
- Consistent CBT-I completion and maintenance: -25 points
- Stable function without work impact: -25 points
- Frequent work impairment or absenteeism: +25 to +50 points
- Driving incidents related to sleepiness: +50 points

### Insomnia with Psychiatric Comorbidity

| Comorbidity | Current Control | Insomnia Control | Rating |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Depression/anxiety mild, stable ≥12 months | Good | Good | Rate for primary psych + 0 to +25 points |
| Depression/anxiety moderate, stable | Good | Good | Rate for primary psych + +25 points |
| PTSD or bipolar disorder | Any | Any | Rate primarily per comorbid condition; add +0 to +50 points if insomnia persists |

### Medication-Managed Insomnia

| Medication Pattern | Duration | Other Risks | Rating |
|-------------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Intermittent non-benzodiazepine hypnotic (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone) | <1 year | None | Standard |
| Nightly non-benzodiazepine hypnotic | ≥1 year stable use | None | 0 to +25 points |
| Low-dose sedating antidepressant (trazodone, doxepin ≤6 mg) | Any | None | Standard |
| Benzodiazepine nightly use | ≥6 months | No dose escalation, no daytime sedation | +25 to +50 points |
| Multiple sedatives or dose escalation | Any | Daytime impairment or risky behaviors | +50 to +75 points |

## Postpone/Decline Criteria

### Postpone

1. Recent initiation or change of sedative-hypnotic regimen (<3 months)
2. Unassessed excessive daytime sleepiness or drowsy-driving events
3. Suspected but unworked-up sleep apnea or narcolepsy
4. Severe functional impairment with pending specialty evaluation

### Decline

1. Recurrent motor vehicle accidents related to sleepiness within past 2 years
2. Persistent hazardous behaviors under sedatives (e.g., sleep-driving) without mitigation
3. Severe untreated comorbid psychiatric disorder with high risk features

## Medication Considerations

| Class | Examples | Underwriting Significance |
|------|----------|---------------------------|
| Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics | Zolpidem, Zaleplon, Eszopiclone | Generally acceptable; intermittent use favorable |
| Melatonin receptor agonists | Ramelteon | Favorable safety; indicates guideline-concordant care |
| Dual orexin receptor antagonists | Suvorexant, Lemborexant, Daridorexant | Generally favorable if effective and well-tolerated |
| Sedating antidepressants | Trazodone, Doxepin (low dose), Mirtazapine | Consider primary diagnosis; low-dose doxepin favorable |
| Benzodiazepines | Temazepam, Lorazepam | Consider dependence, cognitive effects; nightly use increases rating |
| Antipsychotics (off-label) | Quetiapine | Suggests comorbidity or refractory insomnia; higher concern |

## Comorbidity Factors

| Comorbidity | Rating Adjustment |
|------------|-------------------|
| Obstructive sleep apnea (untreated) | Rate per OSA; postpone if suspected, unworked-up |
| Depression or anxiety | Rate per condition; add 0 to +25 points if insomnia persists |
| Substance use disorder | Rate per substance use; insomnia alone not primary driver |
| Chronic pain | Add +25 points if uncontrolled and causing sleep fragmentation |
| Shift-work/circadian disorder | Evaluate mitigation; often standard if managed |

## Improvement Factors

Ratings may be improved with:

1. **Durable symptom control**:
   - Stable sleep ≥6–12 months
   - Minimal daytime impairment
   - Avoidance of sedating meds when possible

2. **Behavioral therapy**:
   - Completion of CBT-I with maintenance strategies
   - Adherence to stimulus control and sleep restriction

3. **Risk mitigation**:
   - No drowsy-driving events; documented patient education
   - Address contributing medications and substances
   - Treat comorbid OSA, RLS, pain conditions

## Special Considerations

### Occupational Safety

- Commercial drivers, pilots, heavy machinery operators: require documentation of stability, absence of daytime sleepiness, and treatment adherence; consider employer medical clearance where applicable.

### Older Adults

- Prefer non-pharmacologic approaches; avoid benzodiazepines and high anticholinergic burden; weigh falls/cognitive risks.

### Short-Term/Adjustment Insomnia

- Often linked to stressors; if resolved and asymptomatic ≥6 months without meds, Standard.
