# Risk Classes & Nomenclature

## Standard Risk Classification System

Our life insurance products utilize the following risk classification structure, from best to worst:

### Non-Tobacco Risk Classes

| Risk Class | Description | Mortality % | Key Requirements |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Preferred Plus** | Exceptional risk | 65% of standard | All preferred criteria met with optimal lab values and measurements |
| **Preferred** | Better than average risk | 80% of standard | Most preferred criteria met with favorable lab values and measurements |
| **Standard Plus** | Better than standard risk | 90% of standard | Minor deviations from preferred criteria |
| **Standard** | Average risk | 100% | Meets basic insurability requirements |
| **Table A** (or 1) | Mild impairment | 125% | Minor health issues or non-medical risks |
| **Table B** (or 2) | Mild to moderate impairment | 150% | Controlled medical conditions or moderate non-medical risks |
| **Table C** (or 3) | Moderate impairment | 175% | Multiple minor or single moderate medical condition |
| **Table D** (or 4) | Moderate impairment | 200% | Significant but controlled medical condition |
| **Table E** (or 5) | Moderate to severe impairment | 225% | Multiple moderate or single significant medical condition |
| **Table F** (or 6) | Moderate to severe impairment | 250% | Serious medical condition with favorable prognosis |
| **Table G** (or 7) | Severe impairment | 275% | Serious medical condition with some uncertainty |
| **Table H** (or 8) | Severe impairment | 300% | Serious medical condition with higher uncertainty |
| **Table I** (or 9) | Very severe impairment | 325% | Multiple serious conditions, requires senior approval |
| **Table J** (or 10) | Very severe impairment | 350% | Multiple serious conditions, requires senior approval |
| **Table K** (or 11) | Extremely severe impairment | 375% | Multiple serious conditions, requires medical director approval |
| **Table L** (or 12) | Extremely severe impairment | 400% | Multiple serious conditions, requires medical director approval |
| **Table M** (or 13) | Extremely severe impairment | 425% | Multiple serious conditions, requires committee approval |
| **Table N** (or 14) | Extremely severe impairment | 450% | Multiple serious conditions, requires committee approval |
| **Table O** (or 15) | Extremely severe impairment | 475% | Multiple serious conditions, requires committee approval |
| **Table P** (or 16) | Extremely severe impairment | 500% | Multiple serious conditions, requires committee approval |

### Tobacco Risk Classes

| Risk Class | Description | Mortality % | Key Requirements |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Preferred Tobacco** | Best tobacco risk | 200% of standard | Current tobacco use with all other preferred criteria met |
| **Standard Tobacco** | Average tobacco risk | 250% of standard | Current tobacco use meeting basic insurability requirements |
| **Table A Tobacco** (or T1) | Mild impairment with tobacco | 300% | Tobacco use plus minor health issues |
| **Table B Tobacco** (or T2) | Mild to moderate impairment with tobacco | 350% | Tobacco use plus controlled medical conditions |

*Tables continue through Table P Tobacco following the same pattern as non-tobacco*

## Flat Extra Ratings

Flat extra premiums are applied in addition to table ratings for:

1. **Temporary extra mortality risks**
   - Recent cardiovascular events
   - Cancer in remission (declining scale based on years since treatment)
   - Hazardous avocations with time-limited exposure

2. **Permanent extra mortality risks**
   - Certain occupational hazards
   - Aviation risks
   - Specific medical conditions with constant excess mortality

### Flat Extra Structure

| Flat Extra Amount | Equivalent Mortality | Example Scenarios |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| $2.50 per $1,000 | +25% mortality | Private pilot (<200 hours), 1-2 years post-cancer treatment |
| $5.00 per $1,000 | +50% mortality | Moderate aviation risk, 6-12 months post-cardiac event |
| $7.50 per $1,000 | +75% mortality | High-risk occupation, <6 months post-cardiac event |
| $10.00 per $1,000 | +100% mortality | Extreme sports participation, recent cancer treatment |

## Combination Ratings

When multiple impairments exist, ratings are typically combined using the following approaches:

1. **Numerical Addition Method**
   - Add table ratings (e.g., Table 2 + Table 3 = Table 5)
   - Used when impairments affect different body systems

2. **Weighted Average Method**
   - Apply higher weight to more severe impairment
   - Used when impairments may have overlapping mortality impact

3. **Worst-Case Method**
   - Use the highest single rating plus a partial credit for secondary impairments
   - Used for closely related conditions

## Smoker Definition and Classification

An applicant is classified as a smoker if they have:

1. Used any tobacco or nicotine product within the past 12 months (including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, snuff, nicotine gum/patches not for cessation)
2. Positive cotinine test result
3. Admitted occasional use of any tobacco product

### Exceptions:

- Celebratory cigar use (â‰¤12 per year) with negative cotinine may qualify for non-tobacco rates
- Nicotine replacement therapy for cessation purposes may qualify for non-tobacco rates if usage is <6 months
- Electronic cigarettes and vaping products are classified as tobacco use
- Marijuana use is addressed in a separate guideline (see Lifestyle & Legal section)

## Conversion Between Rating Systems

For systems using different nomenclature:

| Our System | Percentage | Letter System | Numerical System |
|------------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Standard | 100% | Standard | Standard |
| Table 1 | 125% | Table A | +25 |
| Table 2 | 150% | Table B | +50 |
| Table 3 | 175% | Table C | +75 |
| Table 4 | 200% | Table D | +100 |
| *continues through Table 16* | *up to 500%* | *through Table P* | *up to +400* |
