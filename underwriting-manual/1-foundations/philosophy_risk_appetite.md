# Underwriting Philosophy & Risk Appetite

## Core Philosophy

Our underwriting philosophy is to provide fair and equitable assessment of mortality and morbidity risks while maintaining profitability and competitive pricing. We aim to:

- Make evidence-based decisions using the most current medical and actuarial data
- Maintain consistency across similar risk profiles
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency in the underwriting process
- Provide clear rationales for all underwriting decisions

## Risk Appetite

### Standard Risks
We actively seek standard or better risks that fall within our established underwriting guidelines. These include:

- Applicants with normal or controlled medical conditions
- Standard occupational hazards
- Common recreational activities
- Typical financial profiles aligned with insurance needs

### Substandard Risks
We accept substandard risks up to Table 8 (300% of standard mortality) when:

- The condition is stable or improving
- Treatment compliance is demonstrated
- Sufficient medical follow-up is documented
- Mortality/morbidity can be reasonably estimated

### Automatic Decline Scenarios

The following scenarios result in automatic decline:

1. **Medical**
   - Terminal illness with life expectancy under 24 months
   - Uncontrolled major medical conditions (e.g., A1C > 12.0%)
   - Active cancer treatment (except for specific exceptions noted in oncology section)
   - Advanced dementia or cognitive impairment
   - Multiple major impairments exceeding Table 16 combined rating

2. **Non-Medical**
   - Current incarceration
   - Active substance abuse within 3 years
   - Multiple DUIs within 5 years
   - Participation in illegal activities presenting mortality risk
   - Travel to Level 4 (Do Not Travel) countries for extended periods

### Postpone Scenarios

The following scenarios result in postponement of underwriting decision:

1. **Medical**
   - Recent major surgery (postpone 3-6 months)
   - Pending diagnostic tests for potentially serious conditions
   - Recent cardiac event (postpone 6 months)
   - Recent cancer diagnosis without established treatment plan
   - Unstable psychiatric conditions (postpone until stable for 6+ months)

2. **Non-Medical**
   - Bankruptcy proceedings in progress (postpone until discharged)
   - Recent DUI (postpone 1 year from incident)
   - Pending criminal charges

## Escalation Rules

Cases requiring escalation to the next underwriting authority level:

1. **To Senior Underwriter**
   - All Table 5+ ratings
   - All flat extras exceeding $5/1000
   - Non-medical risks requiring specialized knowledge
   - Financial cases exceeding standard income multiples by >50%

2. **To Medical Director**
   - Complex medical histories with multiple impairments
   - Rare medical conditions not covered in the manual
   - Cases where medical evidence is contradictory
   - Any case where mortality estimation is unclear

3. **To Underwriting Committee**
   - All cases exceeding $5M face amount
   - Any exception to standard underwriting guidelines
   - Novel risk factors not addressed in existing guidelines
   - Facultative reinsurance cases
