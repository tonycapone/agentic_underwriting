## Purpose

The Foundations section establishes the core framework for all underwriting decisions, defining:

- What risks the company is willing to accept
- How risks are classified and rated
- When additional evidence is required based on age and coverage amount
- The company's risk retention strategy and reinsurance arrangements

All underwriters must thoroughly understand these foundational elements before making underwriting decisions.
