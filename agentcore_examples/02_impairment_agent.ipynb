        "# Lab 2: Impairment Detection Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "In underwriting, identifying medical impairments accurately is critical to assessing risk. Underwriters must scan multiple data sources—application forms, prescription histories, lab results, and medical information bureau (MIB) reports—to detect conditions like diabetes or hypertension, then cross-reference these findings against detailed underwriting guidelines to determine what factors matter for scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditionally, this is a manual, time-intensive process prone to inconsistency. Different underwriters may interpret the same evidence differently, or miss subtle signals buried across documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why an AI Agent for Detection?\n",
        "\n",
        "An agent solves this by:\n",
        "- **Policy grounding**: Instead of relying on the model's training data, the agent retrieves authoritative guidance from the underwriting manual (the Knowledge Base you built in Lab 1), ensuring decisions align with your organization's standards.\n",
        "- **Cross-document synthesis**: The agent consolidates signals from application data, Rx fills, MIB codes, and labs into a unified view, identifying impairments and the evidence supporting them—complete with page references for auditability.\n",
        "- **Structured, consumable output**: The agent returns a clean JSON payload with canonical impairment IDs, scoring factors, evidence citations, and optional discrepancy flags—ready for downstream scoring in Lab 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You'll Build\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will:\n",
        "- Install dependencies and load environment variables saved in Lab 1 (`../.env`)\n",
        "- Define tools (`kb_search` for Knowledge Base grounding)\n",
        "- Build a Strands Impairment Detection Agent with a prompt that instructs it to scan extracted data, call the Knowledge Base for each candidate impairment, derive required scoring factors, and return structured JSON\n",
        "- Run a local evaluation on sample `extracted_data` and validate the output\n",
        "- Package and deploy the agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime for scalable, production use\n",
        "- Invoke the deployed agent to confirm end-to-end detection\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this lab, you'll have a deployed agent that transforms raw submission signals into normalized, policy-grounded impairment findings—the foundation for accurate, auditable risk scoring."

        "Let's break down each of these components so you can understand the output:\n",
        "\n",
        "**`impairments[]`** — Each detected impairment includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`impairment_id`**: Canonical name (e.g., \"diabetes\", \"hypertension\") that maps to a specific section in the underwriting manual. This ensures consistency across submissions and enables the scoring agent to look up the correct rating tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`scoring_factors`**: The specific data points required to score this impairment according to the underwriting manual's rating tables. For example, diabetes scoring may require A1C level, treatment type, duration, and complications. The detection agent extracts as many of these factors as possible from the submission data so the scoring agent (Lab 3) can calculate an accurate risk score. Missing factors may require follow-up or conservative scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`evidence[]`**: Citations showing exactly where the impairment was detected—including the data source and page references (e.g., \"Rx: insulin prescription (Page 3)\", \"Lab: A1C 8.2% (Page 1)\"). This is critical for auditability and trust: human underwriters can verify the AI's findings, trace them back to source documents, and catch potential hallucinations or misinterpretations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`knowledgebase_location`**: The S3 URI of the underwriting manual section used for this impairment (e.g., the diabetes guideline). This provides a direct link back to the policy that guided detection, enabling underwriters to review the exact criteria and rating tables the agent consulted.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`discrepancies[]`** (optional): Flags inconsistencies across data sources (e.g., applicant answered \"No\" to diabetes question but has insulin prescriptions and elevated A1C). These alerts help underwriters identify cases requiring additional investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**`narrative`** — A concise, human-readable summary of the overall analysis, including detected impairments and manual references. This is useful for rendering in the Underwriting Workbench UI, giving underwriters a quick overview before diving into structured details.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this structure matters:**\n",
        "This JSON output is both **machine-consumable** (the scoring agent in Lab 3 ingests it directly) and **human-auditable** (underwriters can verify every finding, trace evidence, and review policy citations). It transforms raw submission signals into trustworthy, actionable intelligence."

The hypertension appears to be Stage 1 per ACC/AHA guidelines (BP 128/92) and is being treated with Lisinopril 10mg with good medication compliance based on regular 90-day refills dating back to at least 2022. According to the hypertension underwriting guidelines, this level of control with a single medication is favorable. The diabetes is evidenced by insulin use and an elevated A1C of 8.2%, which falls in the 8.1-9.0% range in the underwriting manual. This level indicates suboptimal control and would typically receive +150 to +200 points depending on duration. There is a concerning discrepancy as the applicant answered 'No' to the diabetes questionnaire despite clear evidence of the condition. Further investigation of the diabetes history is warranted to determine duration and presence of any complications.\"}\n"
