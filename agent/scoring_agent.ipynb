        "\n",
        "**Previous Step (Workstream 3):** The detection agent analyzed multiple data sources (application, RX history, labs, MIB) and produced a structured JSON payload listing:\n",
        "- Each medical impairment found (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)\n",
        "- Scoring factors for each impairment (e.g., A1C level, blood pressure readings, medication compliance)\n",
        "- Evidence supporting each finding\n",
        "\n",
        "**This Step (Workstream 4):** The scoring agent takes that payload and calculates a **risk score** by:\n",
        "1. Looking up rating tables from underwriting guidelines\n",
        "2. Applying the scoring factors to determine debits (risk increases) and credits (risk decreases)\n",
        "3. Calculating a numerical score for each impairment\n",
        "4. Aggregating all impairment scores into a final total risk score\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Matters:** The final risk score determines:\n",
        "- Whether the application is approved, declined, or postponed\n",
        "- What premium rate the applicant qualifies for (standard, preferred, rated)\n",
        "- How much additional premium (if any) is charged for the identified risks\n",

        "## What This Notebook Does\n",

        "This notebook shows step-by-step how the Strands agent:\n",
        "- Ingests the JSON payload from the detection agent\n",
        "- Searches the knowledge base for rating tables specific to each impairment\n",
        "- Applies underwriting rules to calculate debits and credits\n",

        "The prompt orchestrates a rigorous workflow that mirrors how professional underwriters work:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Lookup (Per Impairment)\n",
        "**Action:** Call `kb_search` with the impairment ID  \n",
        "**Why:** Get the authoritative rating tables and rules for this specific condition  \n",
        "**Example:** Searching \"hypertension\" returns blood pressure ranges, age adjustments, and medication factors\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Analyze (Apply Rules to Factors)\n",
        "**Action:** Match scoring factors to rating table rows/columns  \n",
        "**Why:** Determine exact debits and credits based on the applicant's specific situation  \n",
        "**Example:** Blood pressure of 128/92 at age 41 → find the intersection in the age-stratified table\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Challenge:** Rating tables often have ranges (e.g., \"+25 to +50\"). The prompt instructs the agent to **use the lower value** for consistency (this could be configured as upper, midpoint, or based on other factors in production).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Calculate Subtotal (Per Impairment)\n",
        "**Action:** Pass all debits/credits to the `calculator` tool  \n",
        "**Why:** Get exact arithmetic for this impairment's score  \n",
        "**Example:** `[0, 25]` (BP debit + family history debit) → subtotal of 25\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Explain (Document Reasoning)\n",
        "**Action:** Generate detailed `reason` string  \n",
        "**Why:** \n",
        "- **Regulatory Compliance**: Insurance decisions must be explainable and auditable\n",
        "- **Quality Review**: Underwriting managers can verify the agent's logic\n",
        "- **Customer Communication**: Agents can explain ratings to applicants\n",
        "- **Model Improvement**: Data scientists can identify where the agent needs refinement\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Reason:** \"Blood pressure of 128/92 mmHg at age 41 falls into the '141-150/91-95' category for 'Age 40-60' column, which scores 0 points. Additional debit of +25 points for family history of early cardiovascular disease.\"\n",
