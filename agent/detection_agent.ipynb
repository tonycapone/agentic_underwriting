    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initial Scan** - \"What conditions does this applicant have?\"\n",
    "- Review application questionnaire answers\n",
    "- Check prescription history for medications\n",
    "- Analyze lab results for abnormal values\n",
    "- Review MIB records for prior insurance applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Per-Impairment Deep Dive** - \"How do I score this condition?\"\n",
    "- Query the knowledge base for relevant guidelines\n",
    "- Extract the specific scoring factors needed (e.g., A1C, duration, complications)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Evidence Gathering** - \"What data supports this assessment?\"\n",
    "- Cross-reference all data sources\n",
    "- Find values for each scoring factor\n",
    "- Document where each piece of evidence came from\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Structured Output** - \"Package findings for the scoring agent\"\n",
    "- Format results as JSON with impairment ID, scoring factors, and evidence\n",
    "- This payload becomes input for Workstream 4 (risk scoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt emphasizes **deduplication** because the same condition often appears in multiple sources (e.g., diabetes mentioned in application, RX history, labs, and MIB). The agent must consolidate these into a single coherent assessment.\n"
